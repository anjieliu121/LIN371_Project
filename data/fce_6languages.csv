Thanks for you letter. I am so exciting that I have won the first prize. I will give you all information you need and ask some questions.
I could only travel on July. As you know, I am a student and the nearest holiday is summer holiday. But I have booked a flight to home at the beginning of Auguest. And also I would like to go on summer.
The accommodation I would like to live in tents. Because I never live in tents before. I think it is great and I want to try it.
I like doing sports. I would like to play basketball and golf when I am at the Camp. I play basketball a lot and I am a member of our college term. But I am not very good at golf.
And also I want to ask some questions. What clothes should I taken? How much money should I taken? And how could we meet at the airport? I am looking forward your reply.

2. Computing lesson and computer room. Nowdays internet makes us closer and closer. We can get all what we want on internet. It's one of the most important things in our life now.

5. Football. What do you do after class? Joging or doing some sports? You can't forget football.

About the information you needed, I have to tell you that I can only go in July, because of work reasons. Once there, I would prefer staying in tents, because that is a way to remember my childhood as a boyscout and go against the routine.

You are not going to believe what I am about to tell you! A couple of months ago, I was told that Britney Spears was coming to perform in our city. When I knew this, I managed to get a job as one of the kids that prepares the stage during the concert. I was really excited.
The day of the show I worked so hard that I couldn't see the spectacle. And I didn't even got paid. But it was worthy. I found my reward when the concert finished. After been carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three hours, I was eshausted. But when Britney came out of the stage, she passed by me, saw my tired face and invited me to her personal changing room. We talked for about half an hour and when she said goodbye she gave me a kiss. I won't forget that moment ever. Write me soon to tell me your impression about what happened to me. Bye.

I am so grateful and I can't believe I am so lucky to receiving your letter in which said that I have won the first prize in your competition, for two weeks camping in California in the U.S.A.
I am writing to inform that I can only go in July, the summer holiday, because I have got a place in the university and it will start in August. Is there the time I request available? I would also like to ask accommodation you offer are in tens or log cabins. If I can choose I would prefer tens. I like to sleep on open land and see the sun come up in the morning.
In addition, I choose painting and sailing for my activities. I can wait to do my painting for the rising sun, and can't imagine how wonderful sailing along the rivers.
Finally, can you tell me what kind of clothes I should bring with, and how much spending money will be need.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Shopping is not always enjoyable. I don't really like shopping. Sometime when I'm boring and can't find something else to do. I go look round shops. When I see some clothes in the window I like, I would go in and try them. But I always finds it not look nice on me. in the weekend. All the shops are full of people, and people treat the articals like rubbish. Hang them every where after they tried and that was not suit them.
Also in the weekend shopping. You do can't find some where to sit down comfortaly to have a cup of tea. Mc.Donnals, K.F.C, the all full of people.
However, shopping is nice to spend you leisure time and give yourself to relax sometimes, but suggest that never in the weekend.","['RY', 'RJ', 'RP', 'MD', 'UV', 'MY', 'AGV', 'AGA', 'MV', 'R', 'RT', 'RN', 'S', 'RP', 'FV', 'RP', 'TV', 'M', 'MV', 'MA', 'RV', 'AGV', 'RT', 'UD', 'RP', 'UV', 'RP', 'DY', 'R', 'M', 'DD', 'M', 'MA', 'M', 'RT']",0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,5,0,3,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0

As you asked, I think I'd like to travel only in July, because I am quite busy with my job. July is the only free time that I have. And I prefer tents to log cabins, as I know tents better than log cabins. I used to sleep in tent once on my holiday, and tent is more suitable for camping.

For sailing, well, I haven't try it before, that is why I want to have a try. I think it must be fun.

I think most people will agree with ""shopping is not always enjoyable"". Because so far as I know nothing is enjoyable all the time.
Some people might say women just love shopping, they couldn't stop thinking about doing shopping. Yes, it is true, this is only because nowadays people have more money than even before, and some women don't earn money, they have no idea how diffcult to earn the money. Women just love spending money in shops. Just imagine if one day their husbands lost their jobs, will those women still thinking shopping is enjoyable! So it is depend on different case.
For me, I don't think shopping is enjoyable at all. I even hate shopping. I only go to shop unless I really need something. Shopping is just like a nightmare to me, I think I will never understand why people love shopping. How can you face the same goods at the same shop all the time. I think most men have the same opinion as I do.
Some women spend their whole life doing shopping, and most of times, they don't buy many things. In my eyes they are wasting their lifes, they are hopeless.
Those are only my opinions, you don't need to agree with it, but one day you might found out that what I have said is not totally wrong.","['R', 'RP', 'RV', 'RP', 'RY', 'RP', 'S', 'M', 'UD', 'RP', 'TV', 'UV', 'AGV', 'R', 'ID', 'RY', 'FV', 'RP', 'RV', 'MT', 'UV', 'MD', 'FN', 'IN', 'RP', 'AGA', 'FV']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0

I also had to clean the washing rooms. I will never ever help anybody to organice a pop concert.

Wonderful, Breathtaking, Fabulous, these are some adjectives to describe just a little bit how my experience was. Starting with good points, I could say that you can talk face to face with the pop stars. Moreover, you have the unique opportunity to take pictures with them, to have their names written, on your notebook by themselves. Despite of being tiring, it was rewarding because I noticed that all the singers are ordinary people who want to see their fans happy and satisfied and that is true I experienced that. Another thing is that they pay you for you job and it is a good money. Don't worry because you don't pay your ticket it is ""free"". From my point of view, there were not disadvantages.

I wondered which kind of clothes I should take to the camp and I wanted to know how much money I should take.
I look forward to knowing the date of the camp.

Thank you for your last letter. It was very interesting and I enjoyed reading it.
As you know, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month. It was a very good experience and I am going to tell you all about it.
First of all, I had to sell tickets for the concert in the street. As I sold all the tickets that the organisers gave me, I won a prize of ten pounds. Don't ask me how the concert was! Because during the concert I was working in the kitchen of the stadium bar, preparing sandwiches. I am angry because I couldn't watch the artists performing their songs.
When the concert was finished, some friends and I went for a drink.
It was a very important experience for me because I learnt all about the organisation of a pop concert.
Looking forward to hearing from you.

We have recently had a discussion in our class about this statement, we have had a great argueing. Certainly it is great to buy new clothes and have a great variety at home, to wear, but mostly you will have allways.
When I decided to go for a shopping, first I will make sure that I have enough time. I am not a typical women because I hate shopping! I am lucky if I will find something which fits.
The main reason I hate, there are too many people who are always standing in my way (or maybe I ) and I begin to be angry, normally!

Dear Madame,
thank you for your letter, I've been so happy to receave such a good news that I can't already believe it.
To answer your first question, I would like to travel on july if it's possible, because I'll be on holiday and because a friend would be able to come with me at this time of the year.
In the accomodation at Camp California, I prefer to rent a tent, he is going to be more funny, I think, but are the tents singles? I would be pleased if you could give me details about this question.
I can see in the list a lot of interesting sports! But I think (it's difficult to choose) I'll choose golf and basketball, golf because I'm quiet good. I finished 5th at the England Golf tour in 1999, and basketball, because I would like to discover this sport I only used to play at school.
I've got other questions: wich type of clothes do I have to bring? Can I change money on the campus? Are some party organized during the holidays? Is there only one teatcher for each sport, and how many are we in each group of activities?
Thank you for all informations you could give me.

First, we should film some lessons because everybody know (or remember for the growns up ) that it is the activity that to be the most of a student time at school.
Just after, to make a contrast, we may film the break, because it's the other part of a daily school! It's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk free, there are no teatchers, it could be a good contrast to the serious of the lessons. To come back to a strict subject, I suggest that we film the sport lesson, doing that will allowed the spectator to see how does the students behave when they are all together and in small groups.
Finally we should film the lunch, which is also a moment to relax for the students, and for the teatchers, we mustn't forget to film the teatcher room because if a school is made of students, it's also made of teatchers.","['X', 'AGQ', 'RD', 'MP', 'AGV', 'AGV', 'R', 'IN', 'RA', 'RV', 'TV', 'UD', 'MP', 'R', 'RY', 'MC', 'S', 'RP', 'DN', 'R', 'CE', 'DJ', 'RP', 'TV', 'UV', 'W', 'S', 'RP', 'RN', 'S', 'S']",0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,0,1,3,0,0,1,1,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

Dear Madam:
I would like to travel to Camp California only in July because during June I am very busy with my tests. I will do F.C.E in University of Cambridge and other tests in several subjects in my high school.
I prefer my accommodation at Camp in tents because it reminds me my first school. It was great. But the way, I do not like to stay alone. I would like to have lots of people near me.
Among those activities that you told me that I have to choose I prefer singing and painting. I have just attended classes about them. My father was a great singer and he has been helping me. Painting is my challenge because it is very hard for me. But I love to paint and I intend to know everything about it.
I want to know what kind of clothes I have to wear there and how much money I will spend. I want to know if I can take my celular phone, too.

I took a cab and went to my house. I cried very much because my life is really very stupid. I decided to stop buying those things that I don't really need. I intend to continue studying and return to work because when our life is empty everything looks ugly and sad. I know in deep of my heart sometimes shopping is not always enjoyable. But I am a woman.

First of all, shopping is tiring because of the people who are doing the same thing as you the same day! Especially If you go shopping on a Saturday, when people are. Streets are crowded and you can't walk easily. You are the people who are so close to you that you can't walk as fast as you want.
Secondly, shopping is stressful, especially if you had to find a cloth for a precise day, and nothing fits you. It can be discouraging. Or if you look for a present and you can't find it.
However, shopping is entertaining if you don't know what to do. You can a lot of things if you are abroad and learn a lot about the life of local people. Moreover, it is pleasant to try many clothes and to see what you look like in various clothes, especially if you are in a foreign country. It can be funny!

For instance, if you try a cloth which fits you well, it can contribute to make you feel better.","['UT', 'MY', 'W', 'S', 'R', 'MD', 'RJ', 'TV', 'M', 'RN', 'RJ', 'UP', 'MY', 'RV', 'RJ', 'MT', 'M', 'RJ', 'MY', 'R', 'RN', 'FV']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,2,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

AS YOU KNOW I WROTE TO THAT ORGANISATION WHO IS ALWAYS RESPONSBLE FOR BIG EVENTS. ONE WEEK LATER THEY INVITED ME TO A POP CONCERT WHICH TOOK PLACE IN ZURICH LAST MONTH.
WHEN I ARRIVED WE FIRST HAD A MEETING. ALL FROM THE STAFF TEAM AND THE ORGANISATION SPOK ABOUT THE RULES AND HOW TO SAVE PEOPLE. AFTER THE MEETING WE RECIEVED THE SAME CLOTHES. WE WERE A GROUPE! ONE TEAM! BEFORE THE CONCERT WE HAD A BREAK TO EAT SOMETHING AND TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE OTHER HOBBIES AND WORK.
THE CONCERT WAS VERRY LOUD AND LONG BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK HARD. I WAS HAPPY THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER FOR THE PEOPLE DURING THE CONCERT. AFTER A NICE CONCERT WE HAD TO CLEAN EVERYTHING AND I WAS HAPPY WHEN I ARRIVED AT HOME EARLY IN THE MORNING..!
AND HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON

I was receveid your letter concerning two weeks at Camp California in the USA. So I will answer you about this different points.
I would like to travel only July because I think, it's the best month for enjoy my holidays.
About my accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin because it's more confortable than a tent and less hot. Nevertheless, I hope, there are water and light inside this log cabine.
Between your different activities, I will like to practice:
1. Surfing because I never do it and I will like to learn it.
2. Photography because during my freetime I make some pictures about persons, country, -- - So, I will want to have more experience and a better technique to
succed.
I would like know if it's possible to change my activities during my sejar. Can I change some moneys in the Camp or near it? Is it possible to come with another person? And know the different prices for the same holidays?
Thank you for answer my different questions.

As you have already know, your English class is going to make a short video about daily life at your school, that's why I'm writing a report suggesting which, lessons and other activities, should be filmed.
First of all, he seems obvious that we should, at least once, film a lesson with our English teacher who have had the idea to make this short video.
Besides I would suggest filming a lunch to the restaurant at twelve o'clock in order that people are aware of the high level of noises inside the restaurant because of babbles.
At the end, to my opinion, It would be interesting to film a course in order that our parents realise that we improve our body's abilities, and not only our brain's abilities at school.","['TV', 'RP', 'UP', 'UP', 'RA', 'TV', 'RT', 'UD', 'RT', 'FN', 'MD', 'RN', 'ID', 'RP', 'W', 'RN', 'RP', 'IN', 'R']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

I would like to give you, and the others in the class my opinion ( for the video that you are going to do ) about which lessons and other activities should be filmed and why.
Well, in my point of view the most interesting lessons that we do at school but in real life are useful, are maths because everything we do is all about maths. The other lesson that I think is very important is physics because of the same reason as maths. On the other hand I think that geography is important as well because we must all know WHERE we live, what are the problems that we have in this world, what problem does every different country have and where does the petroleum come from and what are the advantages and disadvantages for and the gold as well, there are loads of thinks about geography that we MUST KNOW.
In accordance with all that I have written to you above I think that there is something else you must put in the video film. You can put a few activities (sports) like basketball, football, tennis, but only those because their are very popular and people will have interest on them.
My advise for you is: ""Do not put to much subjects, just put a few subject and make them look interesting ""

First of all I would like to travel in July. I think that this is the most ideal month for a trip to California. This period the days are sunny and the weather won't prevent me from doing a lot of activities. About the accomodation I would prefer to stay in a cabin. I think that the combins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the weather changes. The two activities I have chosen is swimming and climbing. I selected swimming because this is one of my hobbies and I'm good enough t this sector. In addition I would like to swim in a sea like California's because it is clean and beautiful. I chose climbing because I'm intrested in this sport even if I'm not experienced. I like it because it offers you a lot of adventure and action.
As a conclusion I would like to ask you about the money and the cloths I must take with. Please drop me a line

Yesterday I received your letter and it made me happy that you and your family are healthy.
As you asked me I will write you about the experience I had helping at the pop concert. All the children helped as much as they could and that's why the result was beautiful enough. Before the concert I helped in carring and putting in order some chairs on which would sit some special persons. It was very hard and at the end I was very tired. At the concert, what I had to do was to give out refreshments and drinkings to the audience. I also helped to clear up the place after the concert.
It was really a very beautiful experience. It offered me more pocket money and besides this I had the chance to make a lot of friends because there were many children who wanted to help too. In addition I had the opportunity to talk to the singers and have a lot of autogrammes by them. I will never forget these days and for sure will take part in activities like this in the future.

With the increasing of violence, more and more people are leaving the streets to spend their free time shopping - usually in shopping centres.
Shopping may be very enjoyable, in fact, as people with new products, take a look at shops, buy some things or just walk around. But it can also be dangerous.
First, most part of shoping centres uses artificial illumination and refiguration, which are bad for our health. Queues and lots of people going round can be stressful and tiring.
Besides, it was confirmed by scientists that consumism may develop to a compulsion. There are cases of people that can not spend one day without buying anything.

We all have been shooping once in our lifes and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable, why? we had a class discussion and we all agree in some points.
For example if we go to a big mall we will probably never find what we were looking for, and instead of buing what we came for we will go out with lots of things that we liked but we will never use. And that will be waste of time.
Sometimes we have to take our little brothers with us, because our mother isn't home, and then is where the problems begin. Most of the times one get lost, or they start plaing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... And when this happens you get on a bad mood and you'll have a bad shooping.

But at the brakes and after work, I had a chance to talk with the engieners, and I leant something about setting up the equitment.
The fourth day, the singers and the players have been to there to. Then I had a chance to speak with them. From that, I learnt more about instruments.

Personally, I would rather stay in log cabins than in tents. On accound to stay in log cabins are as much more interesting than in tents.

I can sing a plenty of songs. which include the english song and the japenese song, and I have part-time job for sining at restaurant.

Dear Mrs. Ryan,
You have sent me a letter about the competition first prize I have won. You asked me about some further information.
First, I'd like to travel on July at any time from the first to the 30st because of my vacation period. I'd rather have a few days at the beginning of July to prepare me.
Second, I'd prefer have a log cabin where I could let some stuff.
Finaly, I'd like to practice tennis and to try climbing. Is there any ability required?
Could you send me a about travelling in California which could help me?

This book stays one of the best american litterature book. It is classified as one of the ten books that should figure in your own library. But it is also the most famous short story from Ernest Hemingway. Based on a very simple story, the story of an old man fishing, it allows a deep reflexion about oldness.
A veteran fisher takes his boat and goes fishing to convine himself and other mans that he is still able to do that. Then, Hemingway paints a marvellous description of fishing act and of the great fight between the fish and the old man. The 24-hour fight is described in a so peacful, faithful way that it. I recommand this book a lot both to discover Hemingway and american litterature.","['RV', 'MT', 'RP', 'S', 'UN', 'RV', 'RV', 'RT', 'RV', 'S', 'RT', 'DN', 'DN', 'S', 'IN', 'RA', 'UN', 'R', 'S', 'R', 'S', 'UY', 'M', 'W', 'RP', 'S']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,4,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Dear Mrs/Ms Helen Ryan,
I would like to thank you for the prize I won. My name is Manuel P. Martinez and I won the first prize in your competition. I have been informed that all accommodation and travel cost are paid for the company.
I can only travel in July because I am working as a receptionist in a hotel and they would only let me have two weeks off in that month. I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in tents, because I find it more confortable to sleep in beds, but it wouldn't be a problem if I have to sleep in tents.
I would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports I have never praticed before, that means I do not have any experience on the subject.
Please let me know the kind of clothes we will be wearing, would I need to take a suit? Are there going to be any formal parties?
It is important for me to know if we need money and in that case, how much money would you recommend me to take?
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,

The concert was organized by the community so everyone who wanted to help was welcomed. The concert lasted for four hours as a lot of small local bands played. My job was to set the stage where the bands played. It was hard and it took me the whole day. I was there at seven a.m and didn't go home until seven a.m the following day. Of course I didn't do it alone, we were a group of about ten guys. After the show we had to stay and clean the park, which was full of empty cans. The part that I enjoyed the most was that I felt I was doing something worthly for the community and also that I got to meet a lot of people. I made great friends with the group I worked with. I think it was a great experience, and I hope we will organize another concert soon. I am looking forward to seeing you.

Dear Mrs Ryan,
I am writing in response to your letter which said that I won the first prize in the competition.
As I didn't expect to be successful, I am very happy about this result.
I would now like to answer the information you requested. Firstly, I would be pleased if I could travel in July as I already booked this month as a holiday at work.
Besides, I would prefer to stay in a tent since I have never had the exciting experience to sleep in the middle of the nature.
I am especially glad about the activities offers, in particular the sports facilities because I was spezialised in sport for my A-levels and intend to become a sport teacher.
I have been playing Basketball for many years but I would appreciate to improve my skills, in particular the ball-handling.
Furthermore I am really keen on swimming and can therefore hardly await having the possibility to learn the butterfly as a new style since I am already perfect in crawl.
I know I have already asked a lot but there is one more thing I need to know which kind of clothes will be appropriate and how much money will I approximately need?
I trust I mentioned all the requested details and am now looking forward to hearing from you to arrange the exact date of departure.

Dear Kim,
how are you doing? Thanks for your latest letter - I was really happy about your news!
Here, everything is as usual: School, studying, eating, sleeping - but did I tell you about my latest job?
I helped at a pop concert of a newcomer and you can't imagine how exciting it was!
First of all, I helped selling tickets and drinks and there I realized how bad my maths is - I took such a long time to give back the change! But at the end I handled it almost automatically. Before the performance I introduced the spectators to their seats and then a instructor showed me how the spotlights. I really had butterflies in my stomach when I was responsible for the lightening! It was marvellous!
But the cherry on the cake was that I met one of the handsome singers back stage! He asked me what I was doing and so on and finally invited me for his next concert! Of course I agreed - I wouldn't want to miss the chance to gain experience while having fun! Perhaps I could help regularly in the lightening area - it would help me for my studies of photography. What do you reckon?
I can hardly await your reply!

Last month, Alice and her friends proposed me to help at a pop concert. The group which was singing was very famous and I was able to meet them and to chat about their plans for the future.
All I had to do was to prepare something to eat before the concert and to control during it about.
The concert lasted four hours and in the end they wanted to pay me. I didn't want to take any money because I was so happy that I had seen the concert of in live and because that night was the best of my life.
But the thing I particularly liked about my experience, was the feeling when you are near and when you talk with the people so famous.
OK! That's all for now. I'm waiting for your letter.
See you soon,

Dear Mrs Helen Ryan,
I've just received your letter, and I am very delighted to be the winner. I thank you..
As regards to the time I would like to travel, I would like to make you aware that I can only on July because I am very tied up this time owing to he exam period which will last until the end of June.
I'd rather have accommodation in tents, it would be a good experience for me especially because I haven't.
As you have informed me, there are a lot of activities that we can do. The swimming is my best sport. I was born and raised on a Greek island called Crete. The sea is part of myself. Furthermore I will have the opportunity to play basketball, despite the fact that I am not too tall for this kind of sport. However, I used to play basketball in my school because we hadn't other sport pitch except of the basket pitch.
Finally, would you mind to send me more information about the amount of money that I should have. Also, what about the out of the camp? Are there other places the night life? Could you send me some brochures for the place where we will stay in?
Thank you again, and I am looking forward to your reply,
Yours sincerely,","['S', 'RY', 'UP', 'R', 'MV', 'RT', 'RY', 'MT', 'SX', 'MP', 'MP', 'R', 'UD', 'RJ', 'RA', 'RY', 'X', 'MQ', 'RN', 'RN', 'R', 'RN', 'RN', 'FV', 'RV', 'RN', 'RJ', 'R', 'RP', 'UT', 'RP']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,4,1,0,0,2,5,2,0,1,1,3,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

I am of the opinion that the morning English lessons with our teacher George are worth filming and showing for many reasons. Above all, they are enjoyable and interesting. All of us participate. Nobody is yawning or feeling bored. I that the other lessons of other teachers aren't interesting. I think we are lucky with our competent teachers. Besides the practical lessons of the cooking course level NVQ3 might be interesting with the delicious dishes of meat and vegetables. The pictures will be amazing and wonderful.
There are many activities that they could be filmed. We can film our Swimming pool,. It is clean, neat and tidy with helpful staff. The gym is good choice for filming with the sophisticated equipments that owns. In addition, we can film the library which possesses thousand of works. Books of various interest, with up-to-date facilities such as computers internet, CD and cassettes.
We shouldn't and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college, especially when we take into our consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespear. It will be a good advertising, and will help to make the reputation of our college even more better.
Finally, I hope that my modest report will help the management of our college to achieve their aim.","['RN', 'MD', 'MP', 'MP', 'RY', 'R', 'RY', 'RD', 'TV', 'UA', 'R', 'MD', 'CN', 'MA', 'RV', 'AGV', 'MP', 'RP', 'RT', 'FN', 'RN', 'MP', 'MD', 'RP', 'FN', 'RV', 'RC', 'UD', 'S', 'UD', 'UY']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Dear Madam:
I'm writting to you with reference to the letter I have received from you saying I have won your competition.
First of all I'd like to thank you for the prize, I will enjoy it abosolutly.
Your letter encloses an application I have to fill with some information for the travel. Well, as you demand, I tell you I would like to travel as soon as July begins, I'm going to be able only this summer month because my job responsabilities. Acording the choice whether I prefer tends or log cabins, I think I will turn to the first one because I have always loved camping the nearest to nature, if it's possible in front of a lake or a river, if you camping has one, so that I will be able to practise my favorite and hobby: sailing. As well as this one I'll take painting, I'm very keen on art and I think I'm good at making portraits.
Finally, I'd like to add some further questions: what kind of clothes do I have to bring?,, and Would it be necessary to bring money?, how much?
Thank you very much, and I hope the information above would be sufficient. I look forward to hearing from you

Besides that, this character is more interesting than others due to his complex mind and his deep evil manners. It's the richest character at all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason of whatever happens to the others characters. They are always suffering the revenge that Heathcliff swear, cause of which is the miserable situation the other character have put him in. From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated by his bad temper. He's not good not because he was born with this trend to harm but the others character make him become thus. This revenge links the story so without it we would not have such ""Wuthering Heights"". I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important point of every book, film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them.","['RJ', 'DJ', 'RN', 'S', 'RT', 'MD', 'MP', 'RN', 'RA', 'RT', 'RT', 'IQ', 'MT', 'RN', 'MV', 'TV', 'MD', 'FN', 'RT', 'RN', 'MC', 'IQ', 'FN', 'TV', 'R', 'MY', 'RN']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,5,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would like to travel only in July, because I have only one month holliday this year. I would prefer to sleep in a tent, because I think is a great fun and a bit more adventurous. It is not too much confortable, but it is not a problem for me, I like this kind of holliday.
I am keen on photography so I would love to participated at this activity, I am very good at that and it would be a pleasure for me to help the others. I also will take painting, because I always dream about painting, but I never try to, so I think it is a good occasion.
I would be grateful if you could tell me what kind of clothes I have to take with and how many money, more or less, do you think I should take.

Like you know last month, I had helped at a pop concert and I enjoyed it a lot.
Firstly I had to make the decor of the scene, so I made in the background a sky with a lot of bright stars. Then I put some blue lights. furthermore I made some stars in paper in argent. But that was only the begining of my adventure.
The most exiting part was when I had to make up the pop stars! I never had met pop stars before and I was very impresed, but I was too happy to show my shyness. Do you believe that I spoke with Micheal Jackson, my favourite singer?
I can't believe it yet! It was a wonderful experience. I will remember that day for the rest of my life. It was like a dream who becomes tru. I wish you had been there with me. I can't explain how supper it was.
I stayed with him until the concert begun and after the show I had the opportunity to stay in his private room with him and the other dansers. Well, I have to leave you now, but I will tell you more details when we next meet each other.
See you soon.
Love,

First of all, it depends on who is with you and what the other person likes to shop for.
Some people are boring to shop with, they don't talk or comment anything they see. Why would anyone shop with that type of person? Well, I really don't know. Women, in perticular, have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything they see. If it is something they like, they always have to try it on. We all know how it is when a woman tried on some clothes (usually several ) but it's still better than when we're talking about shoes! That has to be the worst. Seeing or imagining a woman in the cloths she chooses can at least help when being bored, but shoes are just shoes. Shopping for them is a very long and tiring experiance. It seems to last forever and just when you think she's done, she spots an othe pair.
Shopping for me is supposed to be a very fast experiance.

Can you said me if is necessary to bring special clothes, I refer for instance if I practice surfing I need water suit. Is possible to get there?

Shopping is not always enjoyable.
I think this topic is so exciting in the antropological and psicological point of view, because we can studie the reaction before, during and after to shopping.
People in general have a compulsory for shopping in my opinion. Because sometimes the article for to buy is not really necessary. We must to accept that media have so important effect in our life in special the T.V.
For the men and women is important the and they spent a lot of money in buy clothes, cosmetic, accesories, jewels etc. And the other they choose sometimes just for the label., because people in general they don't spent the time for prepare food and when they shopping they choose pre-prepared food. We know is more easy for these busy life.
In the other hand the facilities for access to mall center is not good. The area for parking, space for play grown to the children or bus station near the mall is not really appropiate. Otherwise shopping will be more enjoyable.

Dear Mrs. Ryan,
thank you very much for your letter. I am happy that I won the first prize and I am looking forward to travelling to California.
You have had some questions which I would like to answer now:
- Time of travelling: According to the vacations and school holidays in Germany I am only able to travel in July. Due to this fact I hope you can arrange it for me.
- Accomodation: Log cabins would be nice for me to stay in when I am in California. You now that we are not used to living in such high temperatures in Germany as it will be then in California. I suppose I will have more fun if there is a cabin which is air conditioned. If there are only tents available at this time it will not be a problem for me, too.
- Activities: During my stay I would like to do swimming and surfing. I know it will be hot there and California is famous for its beaches. I am a good swimmer and hope to improve my swimming style, too. On the other side I have no experience in surfing, - I am an absolute beginner with high motivation.
- Additional question: Could you tell me how much extra money is usually needed for a two week camping?
I am looking forward to getting further information from you. from Germany!
Yours sincerely

Before we can give our opinions on this statemant we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing about.
'Shopping' stands for buying goods for your daily requirements, e.g. food, clothes. We do not speak here about luxuary goods.
In this contest, shopping means a compulsory exercise you have to do regularly and frequently. It is not enjoyable if you look at it as a duty. But if you realize how important it is for your health what you buy you will go shopping with much more consiousness and joy than before. 'Shopping' could be annoying if you look at it as a waste of time because you do it every day. Reorganize your behaviour of shopping and plan to keep food in stock! Try the internet and use e-business and online-shopping to order your pants for example.
This is even an appropriate way to get around unfriendly service you get to know if you have to buy something in a shop right before closing time. Choose your clothes at home after you have ordered them by e-mail! Another solution to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop.
You have been presented some causes why shopping is not always enjoyable. There are ways of behaviour to make more fun of it. It depends on every individual to change your mind and act as a 'smart' shopper.","['S', 'UT', 'RV', 'S', 'RN', 'RT', 'UT', 'W', 'R', 'S', 'MQ', 'RT', 'RN', 'RP', 'RP', 'RJ', 'MD', 'RT', 'TV', 'RN', 'MT', 'RN', 'R', 'RV', 'RT']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,4,2,0,4,2,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0

I would rather prefer sleeping in log cabins if its possible because I have back problems and I am not allowed to sleep on the ground.
I have also chosen as activities the ones of Golf and tennis. I am rather good at these sports because I have practised them since I was a little girl. I am better at tennis that at golf but anyway I have experience in both these sports.
I have also several simple questions. I would like to know how much money I have to take and what type of clothes I need. Do I have to take with me my tennis raquet? I would be very thankful to recieve answers to my questions. thank you.

I was in charge of the lights of the stage, you know, all those colourful lights that go all around the stage. It was hard work because I have been practising for several weeks. I had to learn what part of the stage had to be lightened with a blue light or a green one. Even though I ended terribly tired I really enjoyed myself.
It was a strange experience because its something new for me. I had never even gone to a concert before. I even got the chance to take some photographs of ricky Martin with my sister and I've got one photo of him with me!!

in your letter I received a few days ago, you asked me to give you some more information concerning my journey to the U.S.A.
I'm a teacher in Vienna, my holiday starts on July 1st. For August I booked a journey to Greece with my wife. That's why it would be great if I could make that journey to the U.S. in July.
I'm not quite a young man and during the past years of my life I accostomed to some more comfort. Tents remind me of the time when I was at the army - I would prefer log cabin for my stay in the camp.
Swimming is an activity I do since I was a boy, I still enjoy swimming especially when it's in the sea, although I never took part in competition, that means I do swimming just for fun.
The other activity I choose is Photography. Usually I take just holiday pictures to look at when I'm back home but when I have enough time - sometimes - I like to take pictures that have a slight touch of art....
I think there are no more questions I'm looking forward to seeing you.

If it was possible id prefer to pass the two weeks mentioned in your letter during July. In August I'll be working, so that it will be impossible for me to enjoy my prize during this month.
About the acommodation, out of the two possibilities, I choose sleeping in a tent, because I think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp.
My two activities chosen from the list are climbing and surfing. My skills in these activities are very different: while in climbing, this will be the first time I climb. In surfing learning won't be a problem because I have been doing it since I was ten years old.
It would be greatful if you could send me further information about details like how much money on what kind of clothes I'll have to take with me.

Sorry for not having written you in the last month. You know that I'm a little bit lazy, but the main reason for not writting you has been the accummulation of exams during this month.
Do you remember that I had to help in a pop concert? Well the concert was Friday night and I went there with the Red Cross volunteers, did you know I'm one of them?
There I got impressed of how a singer can cause such histerism in the teenagers. During the two hours of concert we had to attend thirty-six people, who became inconscious after being trapped in the first line by the other people. Can you imagine? Thirty-six people in two hours! If you have to help in a concert and you can avoid it. Do it! It's the best thing you can do.
Well, I hope you won't be as lazy as me and you'll write soon.

You are going to be jealous when you hear this.
As I told you in my last letter, I worked two weeks ago in Edinburgh helping at a pop concert. The pop group were all young people (between 23 - 30 years old), and all of them were really nice.
Our main tasks during those three days (I worked with 10 other young people), consisted in carrying music instruments and loudspeakers, checking the lights and microphones, cleaning everything,...
The job was hard, but from my point of view, it was worthful. I have learned lots of things, earned some money for the summer, and the most important thing: I have had fun.
Every five working hours, we had thirty-minutes break to eat something. We also had time to tell jokes and play with water balloons.
The most exhiting thing was when we removed all the stuff the day after the concert, and we went to the Highlands to spend the whole day. That was fantactic! If you have never been there, I enormous recemmend you to go. Even I played the drums there!

I would appreciate if I could travel on July because my school gives me two winter. As far as accommodation is concern, I prefer staying in a long cabin. I believe it is better than a tent because this one would not shelter enough. As I said before, I have been playing tennis for four years. I consider myself to be good at this sport. As regarding painting, I know a lot since my grandmother taugh me when I was five years old.
It would be very kind of you to let me know about the clothes you think it would be necessary for me to take and how much money I will need.
I look forward to hearing from you.

I'm sorry I haven't written to you before but I have been very busy helping at Mano''s concert.
Do you remember when I told you that my dream was helping Mano''s group? Well, my dream come true. All started when I was in Drama Club and my singing teacher told me that Mano''s group were going to have a concert here, in Argentina. She also told me that she have some conections with the people in charge of the lights of the concert. You know that last year I organise the lights in our performance. So, there I was, controling the illumination in Mano's concert!!!!
I will never forget that wonderful experience. This really help me for our next performance in the Drama Club. It was so exciting to see the Mano' group singer that I felt as if I were in heaven!!
Please write me as soon as you can.

Thank you a lot for your letter, I am very happy of having won the competition. I have several precisions to tell you and some questions about the camp.
First, I would like to travel in July because it is the only free month I have in the summer. I have exams in June and a work in August. Then, about accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I am used to. I have already been in different summer camps and I always choose this accommodation, I find it more friendly than a log cabin.
I have chosen between the activities proposed to do photography, I have already been part of a photography club so I am experienced. I also would like to practice climbing but I have never done it before.
Finally, I would like to know what sort of clothes do advise me to bring to be at ease during my activities and as nearly everything is already paid, do I need to take a lot of money with me?
Thank you a lot for all these details.

I have a lot of different things to tell you about what happened at the concert. It was really an amazing experience.
First, I had to spend all the day before the concert in the field where it took place, I had to prepare a little the stage but as I was not a profesional, I did not do much with the instruments. I tried to play the drums but I was expelled from the stage by a member of the group who was in a bad mood.
I prepared sandwiches for all the staff during the major part of the afternoon and then I sold tickets to the viewers all the evening. I was very tired but when the concert began I felt excited because there were so many people dancing and singing in front of the stage.
As I was a volunteer I did not have to pay to look at the concert and after it I spent the rest of the night with the members of the group. That was the best.

The activities are quite hard to choose really, because you have a lot of chose which is I like. But I think I will choose Basketball and Photography, because basketball is the only sport I can play well. Photography is a very interesting activitie, and is not too hard to do too.

Shopping, for most the people it is very important because you need to get the stuff you need or you want. For some people it may be a method to relax themselves, after you have been to work or school. So it is a thing you will enjoy most of the time, but still. It depends on. For example some people always shopping to get food or stuff the need in everyday life, they won't enjoy this kind of shopping, because it is not getting what they want. The place where you are shopping also very important. For example in HK. Because have too many people it make you want to stay home won't enjoy shopping.

I am afraid that the only possible time for me to travel is in July because it is the only month I am able to get time off work. As an accomodation I would prefer sleeping in a tent because I enjoy the closeness to the nature while camping a lot.
The two activities that I would like to do at the Camp are sailing, which I have never done before and tennis which I already play quite well.

thanks a lot for your long letter! It was great to hear from you again after such a long time. You asked me, how the pop concert was like which I told you I was going to go to in my last letter. Well, let me tell you, it was just awesome!
My job was it, to help to keep all the little kids out of the backstage area. Therefore I got to stay backstage all the time and to see all the members of the ""Backstreet Boys"".
And, you won't believe it, I actually got to talk to Nick Carter!
Yes, that was the best thing about the concert but I actually just enjoyed the whole experience to be part of the crew. I sort of felt, like I had done my part to make the concert a sucess. Do you know, what I mean? Anyway, I've got to study now, we've got a maths exam tomorrow.

Dear Madame,
I have received your good news and I'm very happy because I have always wished go to California and now it's real, so, thank you very much about that.
First at all, I would like to give you some further information from me and secondly, I'll ask you for some doubts that I have.
About, when I would like to travel I think that my answer will be easy for you, because, I have two months off those are July and August so, my travel should be, my accomodation I would like to stay in tent because I remember my holidays in the south of Peru, long time ago, it was wonderful.
With regard to the activities at the Camp, I would like to choose basketball and photography, because I think that basketball is very complete sport for training your muscles and I used to play in a league in my country, it's hard but at the same time lovely. The other selection has been done because I like to much discover different places and with a camera is possible to do it easily.
If it possible for you to help me in some doubts I have, I'll be really greatful. One is with regard to how much additional money you believe will be enough to enjoy the holiday? Another thing is if the meals are include or I have to paid for them?
Once again, thanks.

This report is to suggest which lessons and activities should be filmed in order to make the video about daily life at school.
Lessons and Activities suggested
Lessons attended in the language laboratory.
Special lessons attended in the library.
Students using the computer and video room
Activities connected with the social programme such as international evenings, sing along parties and indoor games.
Ordinary lessons attended by students from different levels.
By filming...
Lessons and activities which take place in the language laboratory, in the library and in the computer and video room, we can also show the school's facilities and how students take advantage of them.
Ordinary lessons, it is a good way of showing the relationship between students and teachers.
Activities connected with the social programme, we can show how students make the most of their time at school when they are not attending their ordinary lessons or using the facilities.
Conclusion

I think first of all we should film an english lesson, where pupils could prepare some group work or information-boards. I think it is also important to present a comercial english lesson, maybe the pupils could write ""offers and orders"" or enquiries on the blackboard.
Next I would film a BWPM lesson. This subject teachs the pupils how to make good presentations. They go together in groups, then they prepare power point presentations and at least they present it in front of the other pupils and teachers.
It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the brake. The smokers in the school yard, the buffett and the other pupils, who are sitting in front of their tables writing their homework.
I think then we should film an informatic-lesson. It would be funny to present the computers, which are often, or often the. It's really funny to see the helpless teacher, who wants to go on writing in excel or a word text, while the computers do not work or brake down.
I think that would be all for our video.

Dear Mrs. Ryan,
I am writing concerning the journey I have won in your competition.
First of all I will try to answer your questions.
For me it is only possible to go to the USA in July. The reason for this is that I have to work in August and from September to June I have to go to school.
I would prefer long cabins and I hope that then I will have enough place for all the things I will carry with me.
The activities you offer are really interesting. I would like to take part in a painting course and I would like to get to know how to handle a camera.
Unfortunately, I do not have an own camera.
In spite of this, I have got all equipement I need for the activity painting and I am painting very well.
Could you please tell me if I will need some extra money for the two activities.
Secondly, I want to know if I should take any warm clothes with me.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Dear Kim,
It was nice to hear from you recently.
I am writing to tell you about my work at the pop concert.
I went there a 10 o'clock in the morning. Then a young man told me what to do. First of all I had to carry all the bottles into the bar and later I helped some other people to get the instruments in the right position. It was really hard work.
At one o'clock I had a break. At this time I promised that I would never do this awful job again. The food was deligious and fortunately I do not had to pay for it.
In the afternoon I was sitting around, waiting for the pop groups. Then at five o'clock my favourite band ""Tristania"" arrived.
I talked to them and to many other groups that arrived later.
In the end I was happy that I had done this job. It was really a wonderful day.
I think it would be a good idea if we two did this job together the next year.
Give my regards to your family.

In addition, everything is now so expensive that you have to compare the prices. You have to find which shop offers you good quality products for a good price. But sometimes some goods are expensive but of a very bad quality. And it is not an easy task if you have to complain about the quality. Most of the time the shop assistant doesn't believe you.
In conclusion, I can say that shopping is not the most enjoyable task you could find. Of course you also have some good aspects but most of the time it is very unpleasant. You could try to do your shopping via Internet. Perhaps you will find less inconvenience.","['UT', 'R', 'DN', 'IJ', 'RP', 'RV', 'RJ', 'UC', 'MD', 'MA', 'DJ']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I've recived your letter and I am pleased to have won because I needed some days to relax myself and to leave the city, which is very extressing.
I only can travel on because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it's the mounth he can give me, so I hope it isn't a problem for you.
To spend the two weeks I would prefer to live in tents, that's in my opinion a way to be nearer the enviroment and the animals, although I don't mind living in log cabins.
In spite of liking all the sports you wrote in your letter I am only good at climbing and sailing, because I am used to practise them with my father since I was a child.

In my opinion the majority of the people that go shopping are women who must buy food and other kind of things for her family, so for them, shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated everyday and that drive them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money.
Othrewise, there are people who think the opposite; such as: children, teenagers, men; but not always, because they go to buy, only when they need clothes or something for their job or school. In that way shopping can be as funny as you want, although if you do it very often, it will.

Besides, I do not like to waste my time just seeing at a wide variety of products, that make you feel confused and you don't know which one fits you, instead of being with my friends or doing something else.
I think that when you want to buy something you have to be sure of what you really need, if not the shop assistant has the ability to persuade you to buy something you do not want. Moreover in the shops that sales fashionable clothes. Although it is wonderful to buy new things, there are times that it really become tiring.

Thank you for your letter. I was so happy to hear that I have won a two weeks holiday in the U.S.A.
I would like to travel in July. I am going to finish my exams in June, and I am planning to go back to China in early August. So if I could travel in July, and coming back before 6th of August, that would be great.
I would prefer living in tents to log cabins. I have never had any experience to live in a tent, so I would like to give it a go. I think I will enjoy myself in a tent.
I love swimming, but I am not any good at swimming. I really wanted to learn how to swim. I was wondering if there is a coach could give us a lesson during the Camp. Also, I would like to join basketball team, I used to play basketball when I was in high school, and our high school basketball team have won many competitions during last ten years in our city. I am glad I had taken a part in a few competitions, and I was so proud of our basketball team.

It was great to hear from you, haven't seen you since last summer holiday, hope everything is fine in your place.
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping last month? I must say that was a great fun, I've never had this kind of experience before. Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets, they are list of pop band and group which will appear in the concert in order, and some information about their performance and backgrounds. After that, I had to help people who had a ticket but can't find their seat. During the concert, I didn't have a lot to do, so I had chance to see most of the performance, that was excellent. I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars. During break time I did give a lots of direction to people who can't find toilet, and information such as where they could have a cup of coffee. That was bit boring, but it was part of my job.
I got to go..

In this book, Heathcliff as a child hadn't a bad character but the situations lived with the family Earnshaw, where the grown up, made him rude, agresive and noisy.
Heathcliff used to play with Catherine. They were good friends but Heanly, brother of Catherine, hatted Heathcliff. Heanley couldn't accept the good relationship and love between Catherine and Heathcliff and, for that reason he sent Heathcliff to work in the farm. In the mean time Catherine knew Edgar Linton and at the end she married Edgar because of money and good education.
Heathcliff promised himself and worked his whole life taking a revenge. Before Heathcliff died he riched what he wanted.

Dear Mrs Ryan
Thank you a lot for your kind letter. I was very surprised on the result of the competition. Now I am happy to give you all the information you need.
I think it would be better for me to travel on July. I will started an Italian course in August, so it will be impossible for me to leave.
In your letter you ask me to choose beetween tents or log cabins, well I prefer to stay in a log cabin. It is more confortable and I am afraid about wild animals. I saw, you offer a lot of activities, that'is fantastic! It is very difficult to decide which two of these activities I like and I can also do the best. I think I choose singing because I have sung for five years in a church chorus and I do it very well. The other activity I like very muche is swimming. I took part at a lot of competitions.
Now I would like to ask you if wee need some money and if it is necessary to take with me special clothes. I hope I have give to you all the information you needed and I am looking forward to hearing from you.

I had to start very early in the morning, at 7.30. We first had to prapare the stands with food and drinks and buy something which had been forgotten. Then we had to put on the and decorate the whole room.
In the afternoon the singers cames in and I also could have an interview with Ricky Martin. I was very excited! He is very beatiful! At the end of the interview he invites me to have dinner with him after the concert. I logically accepted. The interview I liked particularly Before the concert started, we had to verify all music instruments. The microphones all had to be controlled. Fortunatly we had no problem. The concert was a success. I was very proude of me and the work I had done. After concert I left with Ricky Martin. We went to a nice restaurant and enjoyed dinner together.

I am really pleased to be the winner of your competition and I cannot help thinking about the two weeks in the USA.
First of all, I would like to travel only in June given that my wife will come with me: her holiday are only in June.
Concerning accommodation at Camp California, would it be possible to live in log cabins? Indeed, my wife is afraid of sleeping in tents.
Moreover, I practice Basketball in a famous French Club: That is the reason why I would like to choose the Basketball. If I had to chose an other activity, I think I would do Photography. In fact, this activity seems to be very interresting. Unfortunately, I have never practiced but I feel to like discovering that.
Finally, I would want to ask you whether we had to bring money: Life is so expensive there! Furthermore, what sort of clothes must we have for the different activities?
I hope my answers will satisfy you. I thank you again.

the morning
That is why I propose to start our film with the beginning of the day, when all students come in class. Then, we should film the English class so as to show who makes the film. Furthermore, as Mathematics are the main lesson in the morning, we ought to film a time where we are in MathClass
the lunch
After that could come the lunch which takes two hours per day. The better to do would be to present the cooking personnal for they are very nice.
the afternoon
We could begin the afternoon with the sport, showing the different with surroundings ( ): it would give a good impression.

Dear Ms Ryan,
I am writing in response to your letter about the first prize in the Competition.
I am very looking forward to going to California and I would like to go in July, because I am going to have my summer holidays in that month.
About accommodation, I would prefer log cabins, because I have a problem in my back. Therefore, I need to sleep in a bed. Also tents are not fairly comfortable.
As far as camp activities concerned, I have been doing windsurfing for 5 years, for that reason, I am fairly interested in sailing. On the other hand, I keen on painting, however, I have never painted in my life, so I would like to try it.
Finally, I was wondering what kind of clothes I have to wear in California? In addition, could you advice me how much money I need for the trip? and is there anything else do I have to know?
I look forward to hearing from you.

I went to Madrid last week and I was walking in the street when somebody asked me an address. I looked at him and I realised that this person was David Bowie. Yes!!! I couldn't believe it.
He was trying to speak in Spanish, but his accent was terrible. So, I started to speak in English with him. I explained to him where was the street that he was looking for and we carried out with the conversation for a while.
I thought he was very rude, but I was wrong, he isn't arrogant at all and he looks very.
I liked my experience with him and I think the best part was when he gave me his e-mail address. Yeah!!! I'm not joking, I got his e-mail.
Well my friend, I have to go, because I got an appoinment with the Dentist. Write me soon and take care.

Because as I said to do what you like is good only if you do it when you like it and how you like it and remember if you have long time to do something the you enjoy it more.","['RP', 'TV', 'AGV', 'RC', 'RC', 'MT', 'MV', 'R', 'FV', 'MP', 'MY', 'FV', 'MP', 'MP', 'RP', 'FV', 'FV', 'UA', 'UA', 'MD', 'UD']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,1,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am so pleased to know that I have won such amazing prize in your competition. I like to answer the questions you request from me.
Firstly, I should say that I would like to travel in July because of this is the month wich I could more likely have off at work for going on holiday.
Secondly, I would prefer to stay at log cabins rather than tents. That is because I do not want to seem fuzy but I like to have some comodities when I am going on holiday and I think slepping over the floor without electricity it may annoy me.
Finally, I like to choose swimming as activity in the Camp. I love swimming and also I should say that I am very good at this sport because I have been doing that for long time. On the contrary, painting is an activity wich I have never tryied before, so that I have not any skill in drawing but I like start doing that know when I have the chance. So that is my second choice.
I would like to know some imformation wich could be useful in my holiday like: which type of clothes could be more suitable for me in the Camp? Could I need some extra money? Do I need to bring something else? If is so, please let me know as soon as possible.

That was a charity concert to save money to poor people of AFRICA.

I am delighted that finally, won the first prise in your Competition.
I would like to travel only in June because I will start working in July that means I will not be able to come there later.
Moreover, I would rather stay in a tent than in a log cabin because I always stay in a tent when I am on holidays. It is not comfortable but it still like it.
Concerning to the activities which I have to choose I would like to inform you that I am fond of photography and I am quite good in it because I have attended a relevant course for three months.
According to my work experience as a lifeguard I will choose swimming as the second activity.
Could you please tell me what kind of clothes I have to bring with me? (like.. specific equipment or anything else).
How much money do I need?

Is it true or not? Some people agree with it, some people not.
If you don't work and you have plenty of time going shopping is really enjoyable, because there are big shopping centres in which you can find so many different things. There are new products which you could not imagine that could be so interesting. Shopping is a good way to kill your time and some times you can not realize how fast the time goes. This happens because people enjoy themselves a lot.
On the other hand there are some disadvantages. for example if you are a working mother with three children, that means you are always n a hurry, going shopping is really unenjoyable. You go shopping in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue.
You need to buy essential items like food and you get tired because it very crowded and you spend more time thank you prefer to.
In Conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy. Otherwise If you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood. You should avoid the peak times.","['MV', 'UC', 'UD', 'RP', 'RV', 'TV', 'RP', 'RA', 'S', 'RV', 'MV', 'SX', 'RV', 'RP', 'S', 'RP']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you very much for your letter which said I had won first prize in your competition. I was really surprise to hear that.
I am afraid I can only make it on July, because I am taking exams this month. Moreover, I'll prepare everything for going to University on August. I have no time until Christmas. So, I think the best time is July.
The accommodation I prefer is tent. I haven't tied it before. I would like to know how interesting it is to live in tents. If I can only choose two activities while I am at the Camp, I would like climbing and Basketball. I started climbing since I was a child. I love it very much. About the Basketball, I have been played it for seven years. I would like to play basketball with local people at the Camp to see how good they are, if I can.
Finally, may I ask some more informations. What kinds of clothes shall I take? how about the weather there? Would you give me some pocket-money during the trip. Also, may I take a friend with me, how much will she pay?

Subject: a short video about daily life at school
As I was asked, I spoke to a number of students about their opinions of this short video. I found that most of them had suggested that four lessons should be filmed which as follow:
1..
2. Speaking, it makes you more confident when you talk with other peoper. Let you do more pratices.
3. Listening, it really helpful for improving your listening and understanding.
4. Writing, this lesson techer you how to organise what you want to write.
Also, there are two activities should be filmed.
1. Students are talking to each other when they are having break. It is important to pratise your English after lessons.
2. Teacher are helping students with their problems. If you have problem on studing, asking teachers is the best way.
In Conclusion, the short video is only 60 minutes. It must show the daily lifes of the English students at the school. It should include all those points lists above.","['RT', 'TV', 'MP', 'MV', 'R', 'RP', 'S', 'AGV', 'MA', 'RV', 'FN', 'S', 'RP', 'MV', 'RP', 'RN', 'S', 'MA', 'TV', 'MD', 'S', 'AGN', 'TV', 'MD', 'UT', 'IV', 'MV', 'MD', 'M', 'MV', 'IN']",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,1,1,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I've never been to the U.S.A. before so I think it'll be an exciting trip. With regard to the date of the trip, July would be best because in June I'm going to visit my family in Mexico and in August school begins.

I'm really keen on sports, especially sailing. I've practised sailing since an early age and I perfectly manage the rigging and sail. I'm also fond of tennis, I've just started my lessons and would like to continue practising during the summer. So, I think I'll do sailing and tennis.

I'm a shopaholic, but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable. For instance, I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy, we went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends' graduation (besides other reasons). They had invited us and we wanted them to see us stunningly beautiful.
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen, probably by a gypsie. I was so annoyed! I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny! My friends lent me some money, but it wasn't more than 120 pounds. I had to buy my dress, it's accesories and besides clothes and souvenirs! I couldn't really do much, so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs.

We like to go on July, because my wife Catrin. We prefer the last two weeks on July. Would that be fine for you too?
Is there a possibility to stay in a log cabin. I have sometimes troubles with backache when I coud't sleep on a flat ground.
It would be great if we can choosen swimming and Golf. My wife Catrin is a local master on swimming race. Im not so good as her, but I'm going every week once to her training. In Golf, we are both total beginners. We have no experience but we like to learn this game.
We are both a little afraid, what kind of clothes and shoes we have to take off with us? Which temperature will be on the summer season in this area? Are there some possibility to rent the golfshoes?
Finally, we like to know, when you will send us the airline-tickets and the tripbrochure. Moreover, what do on this trip.

Finally, we had worked the hohl night befor the concert. We had to adjust the laser extremly on the correct position. We spent hours till it was good enough for the Technical-manger. Moreover, the band was exhausted about this great laser show at the end.

Have you ever spent more money than you could in a visit to the shopping center? If you answered no, congratulations. But if you took a deep breath after reading the question, don't worry. Its normal to have spending sprees. Everyone had or will have one while shopping. But don't be afraid.
Going to the shopping centre with you family can be a good experience. It's a moment in that you can talk to your relatives and use this conversation to know more about yourselves. If you are a good observer, it's a great chance to know what your son or daughter would like to have for her birthday or for any other special date.

The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and be filmed into a short video. In order to write the report I interviewed about one hundred students who are studying in our English class.
Results:
The majority of them said it's a good idea to make something about Maths and English study skills. Sixty percent recommended that the activity which should be filmed. Ten of them said should make the computing. Two thirds said we should film.
Reasons:
Although Maths is very boring, it is very important in nowadays. English is the most popular language in the world, what's more, more and more people start to learn English. can help us remember new words. Playing football is good for health.
Conclusion:
It is recommended that should be filmed about Maths, English study skills, and a part of playing football.","['RN', 'RN', 'MV', 'RT', 'RV', 'R', 'MA', 'RV', 'UD', 'R', 'UT', 'RP', 'TV', 'R', 'MD', 'MA', 'R', 'U']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I have been working in a shop for a long time and I have noticed that I am not the only one. There were always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed women coming from their offices and they just spent one hour in the shop whithout buying anything.
However it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable for example before Christmas or during some special salles. In these periods of the year, the supermarkets and the shops are full of stressed adults and tired children in a warm and noisy place.

Hi! I'm writing to tell you about my experience at the concert.
It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the leader of it fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark. The fans started shouting and wistling for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened. Then, a security guard started calling for help. I happened to be near him, so I went to help him. He asked me to help Bono, the leader, get up and to get him some water. I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him. There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger. Like an hour later, he recovered and the show began.
What I liked was that I had the chance to help my idol and to talk to him.

First of all, I had to prepare the clothes of the pop stars. I had to iron them, put them in order, so that the pop stars, who will sing at the concert, look impressive. and handsome. The most exciting things happened later. I saw all the pop stars, talked with them and realized that they are very nice and always helpful.
I had a lot of things to do during the concert. I had to look after the. That was very responsible but fortunately I had help from other person.

Dear Mrs Ryan,
Thank you for your letter. I was very glad I won the competition. This trip will, undoubtedly be a wonderful experience.
As far as the dates of travelling are concerned, the only period available would be in July as I am fully booked for the remaining summer. I really didn't expect to win the trip. I would therefore be very thankful if you could book the tickets for then.
Concerning the accommodation choice you have proposed me, please make sure I am sleeping in a tent, as I have never experienced open air camping before. I think it would be nice to try it at least once.
Concerning the proposed activities please, accept me for Singing and Painting. The only problem would be that my drawing is pretty bad. Concerning Singing activities, I think I'm quite good as I have been in my school's choir for 3 years.
Could you please include in your next letter some information about the amount of money and clothes we have to carry?

Dear Kim,
As you asked me, I write you about my experience at the Pop Concert.
Well, on the whole, it was pretty cool. There was no big about it. The only thing I was asked to do was to help carry the lunches of the singers and to help with light and sound management, when the guy there had to do something else. Oh yes, I also had to check the tickets for five minutes. The woman had to deliver something. The problem about this job is that you have to deal with huge amounts of people. There were 963 persons in the "" Armaggedon "" that night!
But, as I said, the whole thing was fun. You must show a great sence of responsibility. But, Kim, can you see an other way to meet the ""New Bentley"" for free, talk to them and even get paid? That was my best day ever, the one I shared a meal with Paul McPartney. I'm sure you are jalous now. Don't worry they still organise these ""youth work"" programs.

If it's possible I would like to travel on July because of my job. I can't leave it until this month and I'm not able to travel at any other time of the year.
As I see I have the chance to choose what accommodation I prefer. I would like to stay in a tent because I'm used to go camping at weekends but if there's any problem I could be very confortable in a log cabin too.
It's incredible the large list of interesting activities that you offer. It's difficult just to try two but if I have the chance I would like to practice sailing and photography.

""shopping is not always enjoyable""
From my point of view a lot of people believe that it's very fun to go shopping and it's a great way to spend Saturday afternoons and that's true but in my opinion go shopping can be stressing and disgusting.
First of all we usually go to the shops at the same time than the rest of the world and that's a little bit complicated because the shops are fulled and it's impossible.
Secondly you have to thank before you come in a shop if you're going to have luck. I mean that you have to wait until the seller came to know if he or she is going to drive you crazy. Thirdly you have to pray to find the right size and once you've got it you have to think Does it fits
And after all of this it's important when you're going shopping to have a big amount of money or you will end stressed, disgusted, and depressed.
At last but not at least let me give you some advice try not to go with that friend of yours that is crazy about clothes and shoes because she wants you to be like her and that will be awful.","['ID', 'RY', 'MP', 'FV', 'DJ', 'MP', 'RC', 'DJ', 'R', 'RV', 'RV', 'MQ', 'RN', 'TV', 'MA', 'TV', 'MP', 'AGV', 'RJ', 'MY', 'ID', 'MP', 'RA', 'TV']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

First of all I want you to know that I would prefer to travel in July due to the exam I will be taking in June and, afterwards, I will start my university studies in September which means lots of things to be sorted out.
Secondly, I prefer staying in log cabins because it is easyer for me to keep my personal belongings clean and tidy apart from the fact that I am terribly afraid of insects such as spiders and ants.
In your letter you settled the possibility to choose two activities and I would like to let you know that I would be pleased if I could join to basketball and climbing, as I am very good at both of them due to I've played in my secondary scholl as leader of my team and due to my long training periods in lifting weights.
Lastly, do I need to take with me any special staff of clothes? Do I need some money? and if it is so, how much?
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Yours sincerely","['MP', 'RN', 'S', 'M', 'IJ', 'MP', 'RV', 'MT', 'FV', 'RT', 'RC', 'TV', 'MN', 'S', 'RN', 'R', 'RN', 'UT', 'RN', 'U']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend, that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on, you have to bear with the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien into their territory.
There is as well the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself into the crowds crambled in the small shops during the unique day-off you have to buy somthing you like. All this can easily leads to a nerve-collapse, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way across the crowds or while you were qeuing to pay. If this wasn't enough you strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when despite having been stolen, having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry you finally buy something you really liked with your credit card and after having walked a few blocks you see the same item at half price in another shop.","['UY', 'RT', 'MP', 'MP', 'RT', 'MP', 'S', 'RJ', 'S', 'AGV', 'DN', 'RT', 'S', 'DD', 'MP', 'RV', 'MP', 'TV', 'MP', 'MP', 'MD']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

As you already know, last month I was helping at a pop concert. It was a very excited experience and I really enjoyed very much.
I didn't have to do something very difficult. I was only responsable for. But if anyone was been for some help I was always there.
The most exciting about this experience was to meet all these well-known people. I was shocked and terrified the firt time I saw them, but the truth is that they are men like us. They have a very simple life and when they weren't on the scene
If I have the opportunity next month I really want to go back. I will definitely apply for a place.

I would like to thank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the competiton of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
This august I will start a new job so the only possible month for me to join in the Camp is July. I hope this will cause no problems.
I am glad that you offer for accommodation not only tents but also log cabins. Because I am a light sleeper and have problems with my back I prefer to sleep in a log cabin with a comfortable bed.
Although it was not easy to choose two activities from your list I decided to do Singing and Surfing. It is difficult to say how good I can sing but I really like it and I think I am not too bad. I never did Surfing in my life but I am a very good Snowboarder and this could be an advantage.
I hope I gave you all informations you need. There is something I like to know from you.
Should I bring some special clothes (surfing) with me? How much money do you think I have to change and is there a possible to get more (bank)?

Last saturday evening I spent a wonderful time. The motor bike club of our town organized a pop concert. A girlfriend of a member of the club asked me if I would like to help at the information desk. I did not hesitate one moment.
The only thing I had to do was solving the different problems of the guests and just being there if they have any questions. Some people came from Germany some from Austria and some came from England or the U.S.A.
Talking English with the people from England or the U.S.A. was wonderful. They were all very kind and with some of them I spent the rest of the evening and also the following day.
That I reached but the most important thing for me was meeting people, having fun and using the English language. I will never forget this evening.

First I want to thank you for all the congratulations, and I'll try to answer all your questions about for instance travel and accomodation. I have to tell you that for me it is only possible to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at this time. Another question was about the accommodation. I have to tell you that I'd prefer tents. For me tents are a kind of back to basic living and I like this very much. In my opinion people should become more familiar with the rules of nature.
I was very glad to read that it is possible to do activities at Camp California. I've chosen singing and swimming. Singing is one of my favourite activities and I know that I do it very well. I'm also used to sing in front of a large number of people 'couse I did it several times. I'm also good at swimming but I do not do it professional.

Today I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe. Last month I received a letter which told me that I've entered a competition. I was so happy and suprised that I first could not really believe it. But it was true. My price was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at the concert. The pop group which was going to act is called ""Metallica"" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to.) But now to the concert itself. It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg. I started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am. First I had to help with the catering which lasted until 2 pm. After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that I also was not able to eat anything. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guiding tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I recognised that they are very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and I have to tell you, they did a great performance. When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like Did you like the performance! or How do you think about the first group? Questions like you and I usually ask each other. You know what I mean, they were not conceited or something like this. They were like any other person and I have to admit that I like them very much. This was one of the best and most exciting days in my life.
Hope you answer this letter as soon as possible.

In fact, to do shopping can be some disavantages for different reasons:
Firstly, you have to queue for a long time to get a free cabin and waste of time putting on some clothes and in the end they are not the right size. Secondly, it is easy to spend a lot of money in few minutes and as to buy all these clothes, which you don't really need.
Thirdly, some clothes can have some stains on and you haven't noticed this before buying, so you have to go back to the shop. However, it is not easy to get a refund or to change them.

Dear Mrs Ryan,
You can guess how an enjoyable surprise receiving your letter was for me. I am glad to send you the items required.
First of all, I must precise that I can only leave during the month of July owing to the job I obtained for August. After considering your accomodation offers, I'd rather stay in a log cabin if possible. I hope you have no doubt about my taste for camping, however I admit I will appreciate a bit of comfort.
Moreover, I must recognize that the activities offered are really attractive so it's hard to make up my mind. On the one hand, I own a camera that I often use during leisure times. Even if the photograph made are modest work, I am really interested in this activity. Then, as low my level of basketball is, I have enjoyed playing this sport for fun for a long time. So it will be pleasant for me to practice this activity.
Your letter indicates that the pride includes that some costs are paid. Nevertheless I would like you to precise what I need for this travel.

The concert began at 8:00 p.m but my friends and I had to be there by 2:00 pm to help set up the stage. We started by putting up the lights. We had to climb up to 15m to put up those lights and afterwards the band didn't even use them. Well, we also had to carry all the instruments up to the stage and believe me, that was the hardest bit of all. They were extremely heavy and there were a lot of them on the bus. After helping to do that and many other things, my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shoke our hands.

Shopping is also good, when you know what you want. For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sport shop but if you don't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops.
In the opposite, shopping can be disenjoyable.
Shopping is boring if you go with people too fussy. That is to say, they are never happy with what they get and see. They always find a problem.
Shopping is not enjoyable with people who just look around the shops. It is stupid, they do not have any goal. They waste their time.
To conclude, I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable. Even if I like to do shopping with some people and kind of shops I will kill myself because I waste my time.","['RV', 'RP', 'R', 'RA', 'RV', 'RP', 'R', 'MD', 'DN', 'UP', 'DJ', 'ID', 'DJ', 'M', 'RC', 'RP', 'R', 'RV', 'M', 'AGN', 'RC']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would like to travel in July because it's the only month I have two weeks holiday during the summer. I would prefer to be in log cabins because I feel insecure staying in tent. While I'll be at the Camp, I would like to play tennis and swimming. I've done it for many years and I want to do both once a day. I'm very good at swimming and my level is medium at tennis.

With reference to your letter of 13th of June I would like to thank you for the prize your organisation is offering me.
I am pleased to provide you with the following information.
Since I am a student I have to follow the vacation programm of my school, which means that I would only be able to travel during the month of July.
I would be grateful if you could book a tent for me at Camp California because I am a nature lover and the idea of outdoor-sleeping really makes me happy. Concerning the activities, tennis is my favorit sport and I am very keen on it, for the second activity I would like to enroll surfing, because my husband, who is already a proficient, keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport, and I think it is worthwile trying, therefore I'd love to be in the beginners group.
I would like to know if you would be kind enough to send me some information on weather conditions for that period of time, the kind of currency I should take with as well as the vaccination requirements.
I am looking forward to hearing from you and thank you in advance for your help.

I'm so glad I won this prize, but I have some questions for you, and of course, the answers you asked me.
Well, at first, I would like to travel only in July, because it's my holidays here in Portugal. And if it's possible I would like to go after day 10th, because I've got some things to do.
And for me, I think tents would be better, I don't know why but, I feel more comfortable. I think it's because the last time I travelled (with my friends), we stayed at log cabins, and when I was sleeping felt some thing moving in my skin, then I work up frightened and when I openned my eyes, I saw lots of big ants! After that day, I've never stayed at a log cabin. Yeah, I think that's why!
About activities, I enjoy most painting, because I am a since I was nine and I've won lots of prizes with my art. And the other activity is singing. Everybody says I have an excellent voice, I like to sing when I painting too, it's so relaxing. Is that enough?
I would like to ask what kind of clothe I probably will use there? And how much clothe? A lot, or few? And what about money? Will I spend much? If you could tell me about this, I'll be glad!

You won't believe what I'm going to tell you! Remember when I told you I helped someone important? Well, listen to this.
I was walking down the main street looking for a gift shop. (I had to buy something for a friend, it was his birthday) when I found a beautiful store, I stopped in front of it and start looking at the window (outside), then I thought interesting and came in. Suddenly, I saw a man with a cap covering his face. I tried to look again to see him better, because he seemed to be very handsome. And then he said ""if you promise me you won't get out of this store shouting and screaming and telling everyone that I'm here, I take this cap off of my face "". I didn't know what to do, I was sure he was a Robber, or even a murther! Then I said ""OK, I promise!"" (frightened, of course). Carefully, he took off the cap. Tina, guess WHO was he? Ricky Martin!! Can you believe it! And there's more! He asked me if I could help at his concert here in São Rafael. Because the store manager told him that I was the best hairdresser in the city! And his hairdresser was sick, so he and his producers were looking for one. Isn't that amazing? I met all the staff, and Ricky took lots of fotographs with me and gave me an autographied Record. Tina, I'm the luckiest girl in the world, don't you think? I'll send you some photos.

In connection with the questions you asked, please find my answers as follows:
- I could prefer to travel in July as this is the only time I can take my annual leave.
- As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer the log cabin due to the fact that I am not a teenager any more and crawling in and out of a tent has become cumbersome to me.
- My choice of sports are swimming and tennis. Swimming has always been my favourite sport and I can say that I have become an excellent swimmer over the years. Tennis I only started four years ago, but have found that I am quite talented at it, having won several competitions during the last two years or so.

Steve Biko for becoming a martyr to the black freedom movement of these dark years. A peaceful man who was caught up in the wills of the apartheid regime, dying such a violent death. Donald Wood for literally and risking his life and that of his family in the process of reporting the vile crimes of the SA. police force.

What you expect when you go shopping, generally with a friend or two, is wandering around and looking at everything. Having money and be able to spend it in anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it in an enjoyable moment.
The nightmare starts when you find out that the items you like the most are also the most expensive. Then, you decide to wait for the savings but it is even worse as everybody want to do their shopping at that time and the streets are so crowded you cannot even look for your favourite items.
You are hot in the shops, feel annoyed and most of the time cannot find anything you wanted.

I am glad to know about the news that I have received. It is a dream becames and was really unexpected for me!
I would like to travel on July because of it is more suitable for me. I think I will really enjoy if I could stay in tents it is going to be a new experience and looks exciting.
About the activities while at the Camp I would like to enjoy swimming, not because I am good in it, just because I keen on and the other one is Photography.

Dear friend
Kim
Last month, I enjoyed to help at a pop concert in Portugal. Everything were new for me. I had to tidy up the place where they have to wait until their turn. The group asked me make sure that in the fridge they always could find a big variety of drinks including honey and lemon for throat.
Other thing I had to do is keep an eye in the towels, I mean, dried towels because as you know that country is too hot, especially for my liking, as they have to change the clothes and looks fresh; don't ask me why.

Dear Ms Ryan,
I am writing to reply your letter and I am so glad to win the prize. Thank you very much!
In answer your questions: I would like to travel in July. I am a full-time student, my summer holidays begin at the end of June and I have planned to work on my grandfather's farm in August. So July is the only time I will be free. Secondly, I would prefer tents to log cabins. Camping is my enthusiasm and I sleep in tents every time I go camping. Therefore, I am afraid I can't get used to log cabins easily. Besides camping, I also like painting. My Dad is an amateur painter, and I have begun painting for 8 years. I'm good at portraits and landscapes. I would also like to play golf during my holiday, but I have never played it before, will I get any tuition?
Finally, I should like to ask some questions. How is the weather like in California in July? What kind of clothes should I pack? If I want to buy some gifts, how much money should I take and can I use traveller's cheques in every place?
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,","['UP', 'RP', 'MT', 'RJ', 'TV', 'MT', 'RN', 'RV', 'RP', 'R']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Our lives are getting better and better, so people began to go shopping more frequently. It's always a great job to go home with bags of purchases, but is it doing us good apart from the temporary satisfaction?
Everyone likes sale, but those so-called sale items are not really of value. In fashion industry, sale begins at the end of each season and just lasts a short time, because those owners want to make room for new stock. But you'll find your 'cool bargain' soon get out of date and you have to keep buying new ones. Also supermarket owners have put in a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit. Therefore, we become impulsive buyers easily under these tricks. The result, we feel guilty after spending more than we've estimated, or even suffer from financial difficulty.
Shopping does not just effect us mentally, but also physically. It's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping. Think of the awful crowds, the busy car parks, polluted air in the city centres and mile-long queues in front of the cash desks. I don't think anyone would really like to face them. But once you get there, they're just inevitable, aren't they?
Well, now before you go shopping, think again and you'll find out it won't be always enjoyable.","['TV', 'RN', 'MQ', 'FN', 'R', 'MD', 'FN', 'AGV', 'AGV', 'RN', 'AGV', 'RV', 'M', 'UP', 'MV', 'TV', 'RV', 'RV', 'TV', 'RV', 'W']",0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

I am writing to replay your letter and to ask more details about the competition.
Firstly, I would like to say that I'm very glad to have been choosen and I will do my best for this competition.
As you asked in the letter, I would like to travel only on july because I work at the central library and I'm also having English classes, so I will just have holidays on July. Is it suitable for you?
As you mentioned about the accomodation, I would prefer stay in the tents, because it's more exciting and I really love camping.
I examined all the activities that you listed and I was disappointed to have to chose just two of them because in my opinion I'm good in almost of this activities. However, I would choose sailing because I am facinating with the sea and it's misteries and I also like the watter, the wind in my face... The other one I would choose is basketball becouse I'm tall and very fast with the ball.
Finally I would like to know what kind of clothes are we supposed to wear there, and about the money we are supposed to pay for food and things like that.
I'm looking forward to receiving your prompt replay.
sincerely

Since we are kids people tell us stories with two sides in conflit: the good and the bad side. The good always wins, and we are told that the other part is bad, and that is the end of the story. But isn't evil interesting?
On the tale ""It's a good life"", the author gives much more emphasis to the Witte Anthony than to anyone else in the story. He is the main character, although he is mean, cruel and. He controls the other people using the power of his mind.
Although the other people on the story are the good ones and suffer with his domination, they are quite poor and empty, not interesting and not well described, meanwhile Anthony is a very interesting and different person, and all his thoughts are told us by the author.
In conclusion, even though we know that this character is good and this one is bad, sometimes the good ones are quite boring, and we find the bad one much more interesting.","['TV', 'TV', 'RT', 'S', 'AGV', 'RT', 'UD', 'RJ', 'RT', 'RT', 'MT', 'FN']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Ms Ryan
I received your letter and I am writing to give you the information you asked.
First of all I would like to travel only in July because I am going to work in Aougust to earn money and after (from September to June) I go to university as usual.
About accomodation at Camp California, I would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when I am in a tent I feel closer of nature.
I choose climbing and sailing for the activities. Although I have never climb (so I am a complete beginner). I am very interested in learning Climbing. But I sailed a long time ago so I am quite a beginner too.
Finally I would like to know what sort of clothes I should bring and also if I should bring some money. You can contact me for further information.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Kim,
I was happy to receive your letter and, as you asked me, I will tell you how my experience was and how great it was.
The most exciting thing when you help at a pop concert is that you can meet popstars, and, indeed, I met OUR favourite popstar! I talked to him and we ate a sandwich together talking about his album. I will never forget this moment. But don't worry, I thought about you and he signed an autograph for you, you will find it with this letter.
On the other hand I worked very hard because the concert finished very late and after the concert I had to clean up the room and you can't imagine how dirty the fans are! But I could stand up on the scene and talk with the musicians.
When I receive the photos I took, I will write you again to give them to you.

Thank you for the card you wrote to me, I hope you enjoyed your holidays.
I spent some great days in Vienna where I had the chance to help at the concert of ""pearl jam"".
The first thing I did was to controll.
There always was a lot of security stuff around us to make sure every thing is ok, because there really were thousends of persons.
Then we had time to listen to the music.
The other thing I had to do was to make some sandwiches and drinks just before they returned behind the stage to rest a little bit before they continued playing. It was amazing to be in the same room they were. Edi Vedder even talked to me about their!
I think that I will never see them again personally, but I will never forget those two days - being so close to them, unbelievable!

I am writing because I received your letter saying that I won first prize, a two week holiday at Camp California in U.S.A, and that you need further information from me.
Firstly, I would like to travel on July, because is the only month I have holidays in.
Secondly, I would like to stay in a log cabin because I think they're more comfortable than the tents, also because I don't like to sleep in tents very much, I think they're very cold during the night
About the activities, I have chosen basketball because I enjoy playing it, and also because I know very well how to play. I used to be the captain of the selection in my school, because I was the best to play, and I think I can still remember how to play. The second activity I chose was tennis, I am not so good, but I know how to play, I have played several times with my friends.
To finish I would like to ask you for toiletries like for example shampoo, soap, etc. so that I don't have to carry them in my luggage, I think they would just occupy extra space.
Another thing I would like to ask you for, is money. I think it will be an expensive trip and I don't have enough money to pay for it. Nevertheless I need money for restaurants and souvenirs that I can buy in the Camp.
I think that's all, and I look foreword to hearing from you soon.
Yours Sincerely,

One could be when you go into a shop and you can find something that you like, and you decide to buy it, but when you see the price, you find out that it's too expencive, and you cannot afford to buy it. The only thing you mostly say is, ""If I had more money, I would buy it"", or ""I wish I had more money.""
Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended, the people that work in the shop are doing other things, and cannot help you, so you have to look for the things you want to buy by your own. I think this is a common problem in shops, and that's why sometimes people leave the shop without buying anything, and I thing the solution would be to hire more workers.
The third and last factor would be when you like a certain type of clothes, and you don't find any of that kind. You just find the type of clothes you would never wear. This cituation is very annoying for most of the people, and that's what makes shopping unejoyable.","['DJ', 'S', 'UV', 'S', 'UY', 'UY', 'MT', 'RP', 'UP', 'ID', 'SX', 'S', 'U', 'S']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0

I received your letter about the two weeks at Camp California. I am writing back in response to your requests and because I have some questions also about those two weeks.
First of all, I would rather travel in July, and if it's possible, during the first two weeks because I will be starting college at the end of the summer and therefore I have a lot of paperwork to get done.
About the accomodations I would rather stay in a log cabin. I am not that much of a ""nature"" person and besides I have been feeling a little sore for the last few days and it would be better for my back than a sleeping bag.
I would like to play tennis and surfing. I must say I am quite good at tennis. I started playing very young, and I've never stopped playing it since then. I couldn't say the same about surfing though I've done it only twice in my entire life but I really enjoyed doing it.
And one last thing I would like to know about which kind of clothes should I take, if I have to take some money with me and if there are any expenses I have to pay at the camp.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate about writing or calling me. I will be waiting to hear from you

We could show team spirit of our school with sport activities like soccer, basketball or handball. We could also show cultural activities: there is a lot of clubs of music or painting in our school. I think it could be interested to show how students work to write the new paper.

I'm very much surprised to receive your letter announcing the first prize in your competition and I'm looking forward to spend the two weeks at Camp California.
Just because I'm studying at the moment and I won't have my holidays till July. This is the month that best suits me. The second week of July would be perfect to start my trip.
I would rather sleep in a log cabin. I find it will be much more comfortable than a tent.
The leisure activities sound fantastic especially climbing and photography. I'm very keen on climbing. I've joined a climbing group in my town 2 years and reached the top of several middle-high mountains. The other activity I would like to try is photography. I have no previous experience on it but I wish I'd learn a lot.

The opening time recording the students while they meet outside the school and come in could be a good begining. It would reflect the atmosphere when they meet early in the morning.
Filming lessons such as grammar lessons and would give a general idea about a day at school and how students work on their lessons.
Why don't include some sports, for example, voleyball? The team has been training very hard during last weeks. And they'll certainly feel very proud of being at the video.
The musical lessons and the singing club in the afternoon are very popular among the students of all courses. Practically the whole school would appear on the video.

My name is Alois Blau and I'm very happy that I've won this competition. Unfortunately I can only travel in July, because I have to attend school until June the 30th and in August I have to work in an office for experience. I hope, that's possible.
I would prefer living in a tent during the two weeks because I think a tent is. A log cabin doesn't sound like a camp holiday. It sounds like a summer-holiday at the beach of Italy.
From the activities I want to take Golf and Surfing. Both activities I've never done in my life, so I am a complete beginner in playing Golf and in. But the reason I want to try these two activities are their image. Golf play the wealthy people, the upper class of a town, and surfing sounds like freedom.
There is only one more question I want to ask: Can I take my girl-friend with me, of course?
I hope all my wishes are realizeable.

Hi. How do you do? You may be asking why I haven't written to you before. Well, I've been very busy you know. Two weeks ago I enrolled in a group to help building a stage for a concert of a famous singer star.
Activities lasting almost 2 days and a half.
The first day we have to move to the airport to bring all the equipment by lorries to the camp. It was really awful and hard. I finished the day too tired. However, the second day was less than the first one. We just worked in building the stage and all those of thing. Putting the instrument in the right place, testing all the microphone as well as the sound was the rest of the job.
At the end I must confess that it was really amazing all the equipment which varied from small microphone to a marvellous huge large black screen of TV.
If you had this oportunitty one day, you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like just to get a free pass.

First, I had to control the tickets at the entry. In addition, there were some VIP's to place. Then, during the concert I've helped to serve the beers at the bar. I've met a lot of interresting people while I was serving.
Furthermore, I had to make announcements at the loudspeaker for the children who where lost.

Finally, I would like to ask you which kind of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp, the amount of money that more or less I would need to bring with me and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves.

Thanks very much for your last letter. Because I could see how anxious you are to know about my experience at the Radiohead concert last month, I'll tell you something: it was fantastic.
I friend of mine had been helping at a few concerts before, so that time the agency rang him and asked him if he could bring someone else, because they'd run out of stuff. He asked to me to go and when he told me the group was Radiohead I felt the luckiest person in the world (you know I've always been an enthusiastic fan of them, so you can imagine how excited I was). I couldn't wait for it.
When we arrived there we had to prepare the stage, clean everything and put a number on each seat.
But the most amazing thing happened later, when ten minutes before the concert began, my friend told me we could see it from the backside of the stage. For a while I thought it was a dream. The playing was excellent, the public enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there, at ten metres from my favourite group. I even got a few friendly words from the singer in a piece of paper: I hope you've enjoyed it. And his signature. I'll always keep it like a treasure.
I'll show you the photographs I took next time you come to visit me, O.K? Till then, take care yourself.

We would concentrate on students imagination, creation and talent. to do that, it is more interesting to go to art, music and drama classes., in these classes, students express themselves more than in other classes.
However, it is important to observe students and therefore we should film them during an exam (but only for a short period of time)
A school teaches you how to be polite and respectful. The cafeteria is an interesting place to go because one can see if students respect food and if they remain polite towards each other. It is important to remember that short shots should be taken for each subject.
Students walking and talking in corridors should be filmed so that we also show how students relax between two lessons.

I helped setting up the sound equipment, programming the light system on the computer, tidy up Madonna's room! I helped with the selling of the tickets, with the security, with the designing...
But the unpredicted was that I actually got to meet Maddy, and talk to her for almost one hour! The Material girl's the sweetest person in the world, totally unlike the media says. Mo' told me everything about her new album, ""Music"", and how the single with the same name had slipped into the Internet in the UP3 format. She sang to me part of the album's second single, ""How it feels like for a girl""!
Her daughter, Lourdes Maria, is such a pretty little girl, that I couldn't take my eyes off of her. Her boyfriend, Guy Richie, was there too, and he's a really good person.
This is something I will never ever foget. The show after was great. I couldn't believe that I had met that superstar that was dancing in front of a crouded soccer stadium. Hope you enjoy the pictures, got one autograph for you.
Yours faithfully, Benedito.","['RT', 'MT', 'MC', 'FV', 'RJ', 'MN', 'MA', 'M', 'RT', 'RT', 'UP', 'S', 'RY', 'RA', 'S', 'RP', 'MA']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,3,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I just receive your letter with the good news. I am very happy for winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go but I can only travel on July because I have to work until the end of June.
For the accommodation I would like to have log cabins rather than tents because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy.
I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities. I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a start but it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers.
Can you please give me some recomendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to make my budget.
Thank you for these wonderful two weeks at Camp California.

On the other hand everything looks different if I have to make a present for someone in my family. I start thinking what she or he prefer and I try my best buying something apropiate doesn't matter how much money does it cost.

First of all, I am very happy to spent two weeks at Camp California in the USA. Yet, I could only travel July because I am a student and so my holidays begin on July.

I think I would prefer to be in tents, because I think it is funnier and you can be in more contact with nature, but if I don't like the tents can I change my mind?
You told me to choose 2 activities and I chose surfing and singing. In. I did a surf course last summer and I have gone to singing lessons almost all my life.
I have a few questions. How much money should I take to spend in those two weeks? and also what kind of clothes I should take?

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE NICE SURPRISE YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN TO ME, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT THAT I WON THE FIRST PRIZE. HERE IS THE INFORMATION YOU ASKED FOR:
. I'M AFRAID I CAN ONLY GO ON JULY BECAUSE DURING THAT TIME I WILL HAVE HOLIDAYS FROM SCHOOL, SO THAT WILL FOR ME THE ONLY POSSIBILITY TO TAKE 2 WEEKS OFF.
. THE KIND OF ACCOMODATION I PREFER IS IN A TENT BECAUSE IN A SOMMER CAMP I FIND IT MORE INTERESTING SLEEPING 'OUTSIDE' UNDER THE SKY WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE AND WARM.
. THERE ARE TWO ACTIVITIES I WOULD LIKE TO PRACTICE: BASKETBALL AND PAINTING. IM QUITE GOOD PLAYING BASKETBALL BECAUSE I USED TO PLAY FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS AT SCHOOL, WE USED TO HAVE TRAININGS TWICE A WEEK AND AT LEAST TWO GAMES AT MONTH AGAINST ANOTHER SCHOOLS, WHICH WAS GREAT. PAINTING ALWAYS DID FASCINATED ME, EVEN I'M NOT SO GOOD ON IT, BUT MY FRIENDS THEY SAY I CAN REALLY PAINT AND THEY LOVE THE THINGS I DO, THE TECHNIK I LIKE THE MOST IS WATERCOLORS.
I STILL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS:
- CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME HOW IS THE WEATHER THEN, SO I CAN TAKE THE PROPER CLOTHES?
- MY PARENTS AND ME WE ARE NOT SURE HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED FOR THE TWO WEEKS, CAN YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE HELP? THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HOPE HEARING FROM YOU SOON.

As I'm an artist student in a particular College, I only can go to your Camp California in July, because in this month I got no class, and I'm free to do whatever I want to. I'd like log cabins as my accomodation, because it's safer and cleaner than tents and I wouldn't share it to anyone.
Painting and Photography are the activities good for me. They fit to myself because my art work develops itself in these areas. In Painting I talk about human beings in this world, in big canvases; and in Photography, with Collages, I talk about anger and guilty in the families' lines. So in Camp California I would like to keep me on touching to these areas.
I'd like to ask you to send me $1000 for my art knowledge. With this amount I could buy a lot of art books, and records.

There is joy in shopping when it is made by ourselves to ourselves. It means buying whatever we like, just like clothes, records, rings, and books. What we like is based in our relationship to another people, in the work or in the family. So we have enjoyable when we buy what we like following another people's views.
On the other hand, sickness in ourselves our relatives made us unhappy to buy. It is an obligation shopping medicines, clothes to winter, doctor visites, and so forth. A death in the family is not also an enjoyable shopping experience, because it is. Buying coffins and graveyards to bury relatieves is not as enjoyable as buying clothes.
In summarizing shopping can be enjoyable or not depending of our healthy state. Giving examples: we are healthy we buy clothes and Records, we enjoy ourselves; we are sick, or our relatives, we buy medicines we not enjoy ourselves because it is an obligation.","['CE', 'S', 'MC', 'RV', 'RT', 'RA', 'UY', 'RT', 'FN', 'RT', 'AGQ', 'R', 'RJ', 'R', 'RD', 'MC', 'TV', 'RJ', 'RV', 'FV', 'MT', 'RT', 'MP', 'S', 'W', 'R', 'RN', 'S', 'DN', 'RT', 'W', 'FV', 'MC', 'MC', 'MV', 'MC', 'MV']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,3,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,5,2,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0

Thank you very much for your letter. It is excellent to have won this prize.
To be honest I had doubts about winning the competition, because in spite of I think I did well, I had to play against a very strong competence. The idea about going to California for 2 weeks make me feel very excited.
According with your letter, July is the period of time suits me best. My job is less demanding in July.
About the accommodation I would prefer to stay in a tent. I have never done it before, so I really fancy the idea.
I am really surprise about how many activities can be practised in this place. If is possible I would like swimming. I am very good at swimming.
On one hand I think that climbing sounds very exciting, but on the other hand it scares me a lot, so I will play tennis. I am not so bad at tennis but I would like to improve my style.
By the way, I would like to know if the level of life in USA is similar to UK. How much money should I bring with me?

But not everything about shopping is enjoyable. For example, I hate when I get into a shopping centre and it is crowded. I don't like when I have to try on differents sizes because the small doesn't fit on my body because I have got weight. It is in this moment when really I realiase I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling.
I think women, in general, are very impulsive purchasing things. Many times we buy things that in fact, we don't need and, sometimes you surprise when you check the balance of your bank account and then you need to cut down your expenses for 2 months.

For me went to shop it's not the best thing I can do. Well I think the opposite like a year before but recently I think this because I see all the people to go shopping they don't realised that they are outside in the real world poor people who need that money and they are only spent on material things, you would put you money in the bank because you don't need it now, but tomorrow you don't know. I like to shop sometimes but not always and not spending a lot of money on things that I don't really need. At the rest of you who don't understand this it's on your memories to keep shopping and spending all your money on things that you don't really need.
And sometimes I get bored when I'm shopping because now I don't really enjoy it.

I am very happy to have won the first prize of the competition, and I am going to clear up some details you asked me in your letter.
Firstly, because of my school exam, I would like to travel only july. Moroever, I have chosen this month because I think the weather will be fine. At Camp California, I hope I will be in tents because I like very much this kind of style life: I love the contact with the nature.
On the other hand During my stay in Camp California, I want to go swimming because I practice this activitie regularly and I often do competitions: this is one of my hobbies. In addition to this, I wish I am going to sail: I have never try it, but it seems to be great!
Finally, I have two questions more: I wonder if I can change my french money in the Camp and what kind of clothes I have to buy before coming?
Yours sincerely.

As you asked me in your last letter, I am going to tell you more about the last month's pop concert.
Firstly, I arrived five hours before the begining of the concert in order to help the musicians to move the material from the van to the scene. As soon as all the conections was made, we tested the nivel: I found it too loud, so I advised them to regular it, and they listed to me! Then, there was only one hour left to install the differents color lights: it was just enought time.
Thus, it was a fantastic afternoon because I like very much music, even if I don't play any music instrument. Moreover, I learnt a lot about music, especially concerning the way of using an instrument. Consequently, I hope I will play an instrument in the future, especially because the group promises me to help me to learn any instrument.
See you soon.
Best wishes

I am writing you because I would like to answer the information that you ask for.
Firstly, I would like to travel there in July because it is the only month that I have free in my job. It will be impossible another choise, but if you have any problem you will be able to advise me, although I prefer to go there in July because I think is the best month to travel, the weather is nicer and warmer than in other seasons.
Secondly, my choise is the accommodation in tents, I think it could be more interesting, I could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and talking outside, in my opinion if I choose the log cabins it will be like be at home.
About the two activities I need to select, I think the best one are swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I really love doing it, I used to swim every day in the sea a few years ago, I felt really healthy. My other choise is painting, I paint since I was ten years old, I used to go to special classes and I don't mind if you need me to help in the class.
A thing I would like ask is if I need special clothes, I don't know what kind of camp I am going. It should be a dry place, I think but I would like to make sure my guess, as well, I would like to know how much money I will need, because I don't know if there will be some gift shops.
I look forward hearing from you.

The most popular ""sport"" that all the people do it's obiously shopping. This is the thing that hundred and hundreds of people in the world and we don't have to go to Japan we have the evidences here in England. But the question is: Is shopping always enjoyable?
Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression. You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have, buying clothes, jewells, furnitures, etc. and you could have a real great time.
But other people don't think like this, for example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without inttetion the girl get lost. The mother was shock, she didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going out and in, it was nightmare but fortunaly the police found her.
Sometimes going shopping can be stressful. Can you imagen be in Japan or China and have to go to the shops? I don't thing that I'll enjoy it, all the people knicking you, you can't walk properly or buy something, and also there are lot of cases which show how people can be in shops, I mean that some people can fight to get something. Where we are going!!
In my opinion shopping is not the thing that I would like to do in my free time. I think that it's too stressful, too many people in the shops, so I prefer spend my free time go swimming or painting and I go shopping in the days that usually there are not too many people.","['R', 'AGV', 'UA', 'S', 'RV', 'FN', 'MP', 'CN', 'RN', 'S', 'CN', 'L', 'RP', 'S', 'TV', 'DJ', 'RP', 'CL', 'R', 'RP', 'MD', 'S', 'S', 'FV', 'FV', 'SX', 'TV', 'S', 'RA', 'RP', 'MD', 'RP', 'W', 'RD', 'M', 'FV', 'UV', 'RT', 'RA']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,1,0,1,5,0,1,1,0,6,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

For accommodations at this camp, I would prefer being in a tent to being in a log cabin. It is more amusing and friendly. It will allow me to make friends more quickly.
Two of my best activities are swimming and photography. The first one. I go every day swimming one Mile. The last summer I won a prize in competition of swimming. The second one is more a hobby. I like go in nature and make photography. I started it two months ago. I don't have any material.

I told you that I have helped at a pop concert last month. I was really great.
Firstly I was designed to sell the tickets. I was already happy to help in such a big concert than the Mylene Farmer's concert.
I was starting to sell the tickets when a person who organised told me to go into the lodge. They needed one person for putting the clothes into a wardrobe. It was the lodge of Mylene Farmer. Are you thinking? I was so exciting! Unfortunately, I didn't see her but it allowed me to talk with her manager John and her musicians. All very kindly and pleasant. It was a big moment for me. Finally these people are like us, they have just a special job with. The next year, if it will be possible, I would like go back with you.

I am writing to reply your letter about my first prize in your competition and give you all information for my two weeks at Camp California.
First of all, I prefer travelling in July, because it will be my school vacation and I'm not allowed to travel during school times. It'd be great if I could be accommodated in tents, because I've never slept in tents before, and I think it is an interesting experience.
Secondly, the two activities wich I'd like to pratice during the campsite are sailing and surfing. I have already surfed when I was travelling in Brazil, but since them I have hadn't a chance to do it again. Although I know how surfing, I have no idea about sailing, I just only read about it and I am very interested to practice. Is there any problem?

Shopping is said that an enjoyable in all situations. However sometimes it isn't so wonderful as it seems to be.
When you go to a sale shop it is dificult to find what you look for without a help of the shop assistant. The problem is find a shop assistant who hear your problems and can help you. After that you have to wait a long time in the qeue to pay and many times isn't possible pay with your credit card and you don't have a money in cash. So you had lost hours to buy nothing. You can't talk to manager even to give him suggestions to improve his business, because he is always absent. And don't try to complain to someone else because they won't hear you.

This report is going to give us ideas about which lessons and other activities should be filmed in our daily life at school.
Why to film the school?
Firstly we should film our school to show how important it is for our growing. Secondly, parts of our life like breaks, lunch time, spending time with friends will be good to make the video interesting.
Suggesting places to film.
A good to be filmed is our Geography class. The students in this class have lots of freedom to speak and we can travel around the world in one hour and fifteen minutes. Is wonderfull how the tecnology make things so easy. Also we should film our sports class because with this we will show how important is to be healthy nowadays.
Conclusion
To conclude we could film our teachers life too. Will be great because teachers are part of our life and they have to receive all our attention and friendship because if are not them we will never grow and learn how to live our lives more confidents and with lots of good experiences that we will never forget.","['RT', 'FV', 'RN', 'MP', 'MP', 'RN', 'FV', 'MA', 'DJ', 'UD', 'S', 'AGV', 'MA', 'MP', 'AGN', 'MA', 'ID', 'TV', 'DY', 'IJ']",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I felt really uncomfortable in the tent. Secondly, I would like to have a chance to do singing and swimming while I am the Camp.

Hi! How are you? How are you getting on with your school work? Do you enjoy your schoollife? As you know I had a wonderful experience in last month so I am writing to tell you.
I was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance in last month. At that time, I was so nervous because I did not know what to do. However, I was excited to meet lots of people and the pop star, Kelly Chen. When I first entred the concert hall, I was given a pass for working here. There were five other students, like me, who were waiting to help. We were sitting at the back of the concert hall and chatting with each other. I found that they were all Kelly's fans. We were told that we were responsible for decorating the hall. There were lots of decorations and I had to put the decorations to the right place. It was a tiring work because I had to run from place to place for hanging the decorations. After I had finished my work, I saw Kelly Chen walking into the concert hall. She smiled at me and said thank you to me. I was very happy at that time and I thought it was the happiest moment that I ever had. At last, the concert was started. There were many people at the show and I was sitting on a good seat to watch the concert.
I had a really good time in this experience because I could meet my favourite singer. Could you tell me what your happiest moment is?
I look forward to hearing from you.

I would like to travel in July to California. The reason is that we have long holidays at school on this time. Although, the accommodation isn't so important for me. I would prefer the log cabin because of the comfort and the better bed.
I have choosen the activities surfing and photography. I'm a beginner on both activities.

Most of the time is shopping fun and enjoyable.
There are a lot of reasons that could be awful to go shopping. if you run out of money or you have to buy a particular thing which is difficult to find. I had once this problem. I was looking for a special fruit.
The sales assistants in the stores aren't so nice and helpful. Sometimes they give me a bad feeling as.
Last week I was shopping with my younger brother. Awful. He wanted everything what his eyes saw. All the stuff for children are in the same level as they have their eyes. Afterwards, I felt tired and unsatisfy the store.
The shops have bad opening times.
When I feel me comfortable for shopping everything will be closed or you haven't enough time to look around.

Thank you very much for your letter. I am so glad to know I won the first prize.
Regarding your questions, the following are my answers.
The only time available for me to travel is July, any time during the month suits me. I need to insist in it, because I am not able to take holidays during the rest of the year.
I will love to be in a log cabin. They are more comfortable and the enveiroment.
It is not easy to chose from the list of activities, all of them look interesting. Although this is a new experience, I would prefer climbing and Photographe. The first one sounds like a great adventure, while the second will allow me to capture all the unforgettable views.
In addition, I would appreciate if you let me know what is the kind of clothing required for the Camp; if I need some money there and for what; and finally if the prize is just for me or if I can go with somebody else.

During the day I helped preparing her room, then she arrived, and I was there to continue helping.
She was so kind with all of us, of course I asked her for an autograph. I hope to see you soon, I can't wait to show it.
The concert was a big success, lot of excitment. Everybody sang and danced, and I was there to see everything from the best position.
Each time, when she comes back to the room, she asked for something to drink, just a diet coke, because she's always looking after her weight. Then she eat something small and she looks full of energy all night long.
At the end, she took the time to say good by to all of the people helping her. I really think she's the best.

The purpose of this report is to identify which lessons or other activities should be filmed. In order, to prepare this report I visited in and talked to the students and teachers.
It seems to me that it will be a nice idea to show our library because according to the librarians, the library has a welcoming atmosphere and is also well-used, moreover the range of books and newspapers is very large and useful. The students mentionned that it would be very interessting to show the English course because some foreign students will probably join our college next year and it is the best way for them to discover our English course.
To sum up, I would suggest to film our library because it is a pleasant place that students really like and the English course which will help foreign students for their future choice.","['UP', 'W', 'RT', 'TV', 'MP', 'MP', 'RP', 'RJ', 'IV', 'S', 'RN', 'RV', 'MT', 'FV', 'MP', 'MP', 'RN', 'MP', 'RT', 'RN']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

I am writing to you in order to collect further information about my trip to Camp California and to make some things a bit more clear for you.
Firstly, since I'll be very busy during the next three months due to my job's demands, I would like to travel in July. Although the weather may not be, it is the only time I have to see the beauty of the camp.
I'll choose to stay in tents, considering that I want to feel the country in a more raw way. And being a photographer during my spare time and a swimmer since I was a child, these will be the activities I'll like to do while at the camp - I think I am fairly good at doing both things!
I would also like to know some more details about what sort of clothes I will have to bring with me and about the amount of money which will be necessary for me to take.
I'm looking forward to joining you in July and hoping for this trip to be an amazing experience.

As a child, I would be taken to the mall and be forced to go through all the shops and establishments just to please my mother, whose desire to buy, without any sort of control, all kinds of clothes and gadgets was something unbelievable. And due to these bizarre situations I went through as a little boy, everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I'm forced to drink.
It is difficult to see any enjoyment in shopping: facing the crowd, having to withstand the rude clerks and shop managers, trying desperately to choose the right thing - these burdens form the dark side of shopping. Certainly, buying things can be a pleasant activity, especially if you are acquiring the goods for yourself. But situations in which you do not need to move carefully in order to avoid stepping on someone's feet are quite rare and, when they do happen, time passes by very fast. However, if you are another fool standing amidst the crowd, waiting for the queue to move, time slowly melts.
Believe me, shopping can also be painful. Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects. Amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble pains.
Nonetheless, people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake. They keep claiming that there's no such thing as shopping. In spite of our decadence, some cheap souls still have the courage to say that, by shopping, they're filling their empty spaces.","['RN', 'S', 'RN', 'ID']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am writing to answer the questions you asked me in the last letter you sent me.
Firstly, I can only travel on July because that's when I have vacations from school. Secondly, I prefer to stay in a tent. I have stayed in tents a few times and I have not had any problems. About the activities that I can do at the camp, I chose to practise Basketball, which is my favourite sport, because I want to do some excersise while I am on vacation. I also chose Fotography because it is one of my hobbies. I am very good at both activities because I have practised them all my life.
I would like to ask you a couple of things about the prize I have won. Firstly, what kind of clothes I have to take to the camp, clothes for hot or cold weather?. I also wanted to know if I have to take some money to buy souvenirs and food or that will be paid for me, too?

I am writing to tell you about my experience at a pop concert last month.
As you know, I am a member of a BSB fan club, and last month we had the opportunity to help at a concert they gave in the city where I live. Firstly, I helped selling the tickets. That wasn't difficult because everybody wanted to go. The day of the concert we helped to clean the place where the concert was performed and to have everything in order so the concert could be a succes, which it was.
What I particularly liked about this experience was meeting my favourite pop group and talk with them about their lifes as a pop group. I also enjoyed being able to work as a team with both all the members of the club and the BSB. It was one of the best experiences I have had in all my life

Dear Mrs Ryan:
I am very glad I won the Competition to go to Camp California.
I must say though, I would have to travel on July because it's the summer holydays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friend if it is possible.
Log cabines will be ideal accomodation, presumably they are more spacious than tent and it would be easier to keep tidy. It's always nice to have a warm, clean place to go to after sailing which is one of the activities I would like to do. And I'm quite good at. Climbing would be my second option, for this I'm afraid I would need some instruction for I've only done it a few times.
I would like to know how much money do people ussually take and how many clothes.

Dear Kim:
Well, you want to know what I did in the concert? Help..
I know it sound extremely boring and that is exactly what I thought when I was asked to help, but to my suprise it turned out to be much more fun that expected.
About 20 people were helping apart from me, we had some kind of rotation system so that all the volunteers could also enjoy some of the concert.
Of course there was the cooking and bar-tending for anyone who was hungry during the brakes. The hard work, though, started when everyone left at the end of the concert. It was in fact more fun than the concert itself; believe it or not, all the popstars came to help us clean up and we all had a food fight with the left-overs!
It was so fun, that I enjoyed it a lot. If you ever know of a concert that needs volunteers tell me, I'm in!!!

Sorry for not writing you before, but I have been so busy, because last weak I went to a pop concert to help the singers.
First, when I arrived they told me to go to a big room, where the singers try on their clothes and they are made-up. There, in the room I had to helped them, I the singers, to put on theirs clothes, and I had to make-up them. A few minutes later the show started and the grup appeared on the stage. While they were singing a man told me to clean the room, where the singers get dressed. Later, when the show had finished, I stayed with the grup in their room for a few minutes. Then, they went to the airport, and my dream finished.

About the information required, I would like to go in July because is my half term at University and summer time would be ideal.
For accommodation I would rather go in a tent, I want to enjoy wild life and admire the landscape.
In relation with leisure activities, my favourites are Basketball, which I have been playing for two years because I have been selected for my University team and I think a time practising with players from different countries will help me develop my skills at international level.
Secondly, I would like to practise tennis, which is my hobby and I think it helps my mind to keep working.
I would like to ask you how much money do I need, how is the weather in order to pack the necessary clothe and wheter I need something else.
Yours sincerely.","['S', 'MA', 'RP', 'RP', 'RT', 'MP', 'RV', 'RP', 'MD', 'RP', 'R', 'AGA', 'AGV', 'MP', 'RP', 'RQ', 'MD', 'RV', 'UV', 'W', 'MP', 'DN', 'MP', 'S', 'RA']",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,5,1,1,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

What a fantastic experience I had helping my favourite group!
You wouldn't believe it! I was working helping to mantle and dismantle the stage, sometimes I had to check the sound by saying something on the microphone, that was my chance and I always pretended to be a singer and that I sand in duo with the vocalist of the group, it was such a great fun!
But the most exciting part of my job, and the one that I was looking forward to, was the last night of concert, because all the staff were promised to have a party with all the members of the band. That night was the best of my entire life.
I send you some pictures, the best ones because there were some quite embarrasing.
I hope you like them and I am already waiting for your next letter.

Dear Edouard,
Firstly, let me thank you for your nice letter of June 10th. I was so surprised but so glad to read that I won the first prize in your competition.
In response to your question and if you don't mind, I would prefer to travel in July because I've already chosen my holiday and my boss won't give me another one.
I would be grateful if I could accommodate in a log cabin. I'm no more a young girl! and do appreciate a little bit of comfort.
As you asked me, my favourite activities would be painting and climbing. I like very much the moutains and would particularly enjoy painting them after a walk. Would you be so kind as to write me as soon as possible because I need the accurate date of the journey. I've got four children and have to organise their time without mother.
Furthermore, I would like to know exactly which kind of clothes I have to take with and how much money I'll be supposed to spend there. I'm really looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfully,

How are you my lovely penfriend? I hope good. You want to know how was it to work and help at a pop concert? It is marvelous. You see the stars so near and also you can chat with them. On my first day I should help to bring the staff for the band, things like guitars, drums and others. It was maybe hard work for a while but I was so happy about that to help on a real big pop concert I can't decribe it. On the other two days I helped to prepare the breakfast, lunch and diner for the band. You are always so near to these people and after a while it is normal to stay and chat with Brian Adams, for example. I realy enjoyed that and it was one of the greatest, when not the greatest experience in my life. On the other hand it was a good paid job with 15 pounds per hour, what do you can say.
The organizer of the tournement have spoken with me and asked me if I want I could do the same work in two months at the concert by the Rolling Stones is fantastic.

That's my only month for holidays in the whole year. If possible, I'd like to spend my time there in a tent. I hope. That's the best suitable accomodation for a camping. It just keeps you in touch with nature. That's what camping is about, isn't it? I've found the list of activities you sent me very interesting. If I have to choose two of them I'll take tennis first. I'm an expert on it and I'll have a good time beating everyone there. Can't say the same about golf. It will be my first experience with the putt. I just hope not to get injured.

As I told you in my previous letter I finally had the opportunity to take part on the Sting concert here in Segovia. No, not as a singer. Not yet. My only role was to carry things from one place to another. Very heavy things, those which Sting uses to make his show even more spectacular. Have you seen the giant screen behind him in every concert? I was the one who put it there in Segovia. Well, some others helped me in the task, but that did not make it much easier.
Any way, it was a great experience and I enjoy it very much. The part I enjoyed most was the one when they paid me. It wasn't much but that means nothing when you have the chance to take part in an event like that. They also gave me a ticket to wotch the concert live. Great show.

I am really surprised about the free journey to California, because I've never ever won anything before.
My summer holidays last for two months, but I just have time in July. In August I am going to work in an office, so there is not possibility to travel away this month.
I would prefer the accommodation in a log cabin. For one night it would not disturb me to sleep in a tent, but for a period of two weeks it would be too uncomfortable.
At the Camp I would like to go sailing a lot. Once my family and I went to Greece and rent a sailing boat for three weeks. Because most of the work did my parents, I don't know exactly how to handle a sailing boat.
As the second activity I have chosen to make photos. I'm used to be the photographer at the holidays with my family and I know how a camera works.
Finally I have some questions concerning the clothes I am going to need and how much money I should estimately take with me. I just want to know, what I will have to pay alone.
Thank you very much for giving me the chance to discover a new type of landscape!

If you want to buy new clothes for summer the biggest difficulty is to find a shop, which sells what you are looking for. Once you've found you should take everything you like and go into the cabin.
It's a big advantage to go shopping with a friend, because he or she can bring you all the clothes in a suitable size if the one you took doesn't fit. Often it happens that the salesman hasn't got the size you need and that's always a pity.

I am writing to you about my previous experience. I know how impatient you are about it and I just want to let you know that it was something amazing!
As I've told you, last month I went at a pop concert and I really enjoy helping with the preparation. It took place in a huge stadium which had over 4.000 seats for the "" spactetors "" if you can call them like this. Can you imagine?
There was a large stage which we had to clean by sweeping. That was a little bit odd but and funny at the same time. Another thing we had to do was help the staff to tranfer some equipment. The musicians brough it in order to achieve a high standard of quality sound. We had to be very careful. Have you any idea how much does this stuff worth? You don't even want to know.
Apart from these we were mainly helping the singers to be prepared for the concert. They had to chose their clothes, give one last performance before the big night and everything had to be perfect!
Even if I could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that I've gained through it! I've learned the meaning of the words ""reliability"" and ""responsibility"". Anyway the result of the whole preparation is far more enjoyable and relaxing.

First of all I would be pleased if the accommodation is in log cabin because I'm afraid of insects and it's wet in the tent. It'll make me like at the village.

Women always enjoy shopping. But a lot of incovenients anoy them. So they said they do not always enjoy shopping. First of all the car parking is not convinent and expensive. Sometimes you can't find a place to park your car. Sometimes you have to park your car in a place then walk to the supermarket.
Futhermore when you look aroud the supermarket, you can't easyly find the goods which you want to buy. It's very confusing without right singho. Sometimes you get lost in the supermarket.
Otherwise men always don't like shopping, while their wives are doing shopping they sit in the car or read newspaper. They would be happy if there are sports and leisure facilities in the supermarket. They'll change their mind. Instead of hating shopping they will enjoying shopping.
In my opinion nowadays shopping is not always enjoyable.","['TV', 'UT', 'DN', 'S', 'UN', 'S', 'MV', 'RJ', 'S', 'MP', 'S', 'DY', 'MD', 'S', 'RY', 'MP', 'X', 'RP', 'MD', 'MD', 'TV', 'TV', 'MY', 'TV', 'FV', 'MP', 'MP']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

I'm writing to you with regard to the letter I've just received as I wish to give you some further information about myself.
I would rather travel on July because I'm not as busy as on June or August and because in my opinion during July there's excellent weather.
Regarding the accommodation I would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep and they aren't very cozy.
Regarding the activities I've chosen swimming as I'm very keen on it and I'm fairly good at it, but I expect the water to be as crystal clear. I've also chosen singing. I'm an awful singer, but I would like to learn.
I would like to ask you for vegetarian food for me as I am a very extrict vegan, and to suggest me what kind of clothes to bring.
I'm really looking forward to my stay at Camp California and to your response in this regard.

70% of students think we should film the Speech and Drama lesson because is one of the lessons they enjoy the most.
The vast majority say Maths and History should be filmed too, because they love these subjects and think they are very interesting and are also great fun.
60% of students say breaks should be filmed too, because they want to show in the video they can also have fun at school.
Most of them said Science, English and Literature shouldn't be filmed because they are not very interesting and are also very boring.
In my opinion I think basketball should be filmed too because is one of the activities the students are very keen on doing and they usually enjoy it.
But I don't think we should film breaks, because in my opinion everyone knows how breaks are and what students do during them.
In a nutchel I think Maths, basketball, Speech and Drama, and History should be filmed.

Student X will meet friends on his way to school and start talking with them. Actually one of us will hold the camera while another will stand next to him, as the ""voice"" of X.
At school we want to show ""sights and sounds"" from all lessons (about 5 minutes each). Student X will answer questions, speak with his classmates, even cheat at an exam!

First of all I was too busy but it does not matter because I enjoyed a lot of. I was doing different activities from designering flier to selling tickets.
I had to search in the internet pictures that could be used for the flier. We booked the accommodation for the group. I was responsible for checking the light and sound. In addition I checked the e-mail dialy and answered the phone. As you know I sold tickets in some schools and pubs, too.
Anyway, it has been one of the most wonderful experience in my life, but the concert day was really amazing. I think this was the best of all. I feel really happy that I participated in this event.

I am writing to answer the informations that you need from me.
First I would like to thank you for doing this competition and I would also like to thank you for the prize.
Answering your questions, I would like to travel only en July because this is the month of my vacations. In July I will be free to travel anywhere I please.
According to your letter I have two options of accommodation, or in tents or log cabins. I would prefer in tents because I think that is something more exciting and new for me. I never stayed in tents in the middle of nowhere, in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new. Log cabins may be more confortable, on the other hand I think that I will be able to ""survive"" in tents. Looking to your letter, I can see many options of activities and I realized that I like most of them. I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting. The reason of choosing this two activities is that they contrast itselves, I want one more exciting and that asks for more agility and another more calm and relaxing, that asks only for my ability to paint. Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good on that, however I wish that I can learn about it on the Camp. Painting is something that I love and I am very good doing it.
I have some doubts about my prize and travel. Is there a possibility that you send me a list of material and clothes that I have to take?
Is all the travel already paid including food and meals, or I have to bring some money?
Do I have to bring something especial for the tents and camping?
Please answer my letter as soon as is possible.

How are you? Is everything good in USA?
I'm writing to you because I had a wonderful experience last month.
There was a concert of a famous band here in my city. I vish you were here with me. So, I went with my friend to the concert with a lot of fans. We bought tickets to the show and also to the fan's bus. Yes, there is a bus that take you to the concert and bring you back.
The concert was going to start at 22:00 and the bus arrived at my house at 18:00. When we entered inside of it, we saw a lot of fans using T-shirts, caps and shouting, ""Almendegos, Almendegos..."" (that is the name of the band).
AT 20:00, we stopped in a coffee house to eat. The shouted: ""20:30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave.""
We sat and started to eat and talk. Suddenly a man came and started to tell us his adventures. They were very interesting and we liked him so much. After a few minutes (I fought were few) I realized that the coffee house was empty. I looked to my watch: 20:45. The bus had left about fifteen minutes. The man offered a ride. We accept. You can not imagine how dissapointed I were with my ownself.
When we arrived the concert had already began. When we were running to enter a man called us. He was helping to put the materials (microphone...) on the stage. He asked if we could help. We answered: ""Yes!""
We started to put everthing on the stage and after this we realized that the band was entering into the stage near us.
By my side the vocal and he touched my arm. I will never wash my arm again. After all of this we saw the show in the best place, near of the stage and after, the thing that I most liked, we were convidated to see the group and had their signatures.
That was the best night of my life.
I wish that you liked my experience.

I have been helping to organise a pop concert in Dublin. As you know I love irish music so I was very happy when the organisers of the concert phone me to help them.
The organisers paid for my acommodation and travel to Ireland.
I arrived at Ireland on 2th July. On my first day I didn't work. On the next day I helped them to built the scenary and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening. On my third day I helped them to install the sound system. While we were installing the sound system we listened irish music and suddenly we saw to U2, which is my favourite group, going inside the stadium and they played music for us.
I could speak to my favourite singer 'Bono', I could meet him and I helped him to repair his guitar because it didn't sound very well.
The rest of the days I wasn't doing anything especial, just I helped to organise the rehearsals of the differents group who were going to play in the concert.

However, in your letter is written some activities. I would choose Basketball and Tennis. Basketball I have been playing in a team, of my town for ten years. Also Tennis is my favourite hobby and I play twice every week with my friends.

I was going to markets to schools and I was giving information when and where the group was going to appear as well as where can buy or book a ticket for this concert. I know, It was difficult and tired but I enjoyed a lot. Firstly, it was a good break from the routine. Because I did it for first time.

If you are used to go to the Shopping very often, maybe is because you don't know about all the others good things you can do on your weekend.
People are used to go to the shopping because it is easier and familiare, it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch some movie after that, and if you want buy something at the shops.
On the other hand, everything at the shopping is more expensive, because the people that buy on it usually don't compare prices or look for cheaper shops, because all they need it is already at this place.

Shopping, is becoming a popular way of killing time nowdays. In some peoples' opinion, shopping and spending money is a kind of fun and they can even get self-satisfaction from it.
However, more and more people are now asking, ""Is shopping always so enjoyable?"" In my view, the answer is, NO.
Firstly, since more and more people go shopping, shops are always so crowded, especially the popular ones. Try to imagine the scence: twenty or thirty or even more people are keeping a quel outside the fitting room. Would you say that shopping is enjoyable? Would you be patient enough to wait for half an hour or more just because you wanna buy a T-shirt?
Secondly, the cost is also a problem. It will be really an annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it. One of my friend, Emma, happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs £105. Then she spent all her spare time doing part-time jobs to earn money. After a week, she had got enough money and rushed to that shop. But it was just not there! She felt really badly after that. So, would you still say that shopping is enjoyable?
More and more people find that there are a lot of nicer things they can do rather than shopping. Shopping is not always enjoyable. Sometimes it can be a waste of time. So, let's have a new life style in this new generation!","['UP', 'S', 'RP', 'RN', 'RN', 'S', 'R', 'S', 'L', 'TV', 'W', 'AGN', 'DJ', 'RP']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Competition Organizer
Dear Madam,
Thank you for this great opportunity to travel with you for free! I entered the competition you organized but never expected to be the lucky winner.
I could only travel on the first week of July because I have to join my parents on their trip to Italy, due to start on the 20th.
The accomodation that best suits me is in log cabins, as the space in tents is very limited and I am not used to have all my belongings in order and packed at all times.
In respect of the activities you offer, it is difficult to choose in such a hugh variety, but I prefer to do those I better know as climbing. I've been studying Photography on my own, and I am looking forward to practise new techniques and take pictures of new landscapes.
Please send me a list of the items I many need there, including the most appropriate clothes for the american weather. I would also like to know in advance the amount of money I need to bring for expenses that will not be included.

Most of us would agree on that. Who has never had a bad experience related with an unsatisfactory product? Moreover, who has the freedom to buy with? And finally who has all the time needed to do so?
There are many things that can go wrong in the process of adquiring a product or service. And whenever money is involved, some problems are likely to happen. Thieves will try to put their hands in our wallets and purses, and even the so called 'plastic money' is not always safe.
Hunting on the High Street, or the Shopping Malls, for the desired bargain - because we cant afford otherwise to buy - becomes often a desperate atempt to reach a living promoted by the new consuming society. And nobody can say they would rather go back to the caverns' age where money was not even invented.
With more free time and more money to spend than ever, shopping is a great activity, but when this creates bad habits as overspending, could lead to serious problems.
At the end all depends in our attitud to life, including shopping. I particularly enjoy making lists of the products before going shopping. But even without money to spend is fun to rush from time to time in the sales that seasonaly appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms.

Having won the trip to California delights me and I am providing you the further informations you asked for:
I only have two months of vacation that are July and August and since I must visit my grandparents in August, the only time possible is July.
I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the Californiai summer is hot and dry so because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a confortable coolness. The two activities I would like to do are basketball and surfing. I have played basketball during 5 years in an amateur franchise and still play on a playground regularly so my skills are good. On the other hand, I am a complete debutant concerning surfing. This sport has always attracted me due to its contact with the sea and the great sensations it provides and I believe this is the perfect occasion to initiate myself to the exciting sport, I still have some questions to ask you:
Do I need to bring particular clothing like a surfing suit, for instance? Is any ""pocket money"" required in case there is something I need to pay for? And finally, is somebody going to fetch me at the airport or am I supposed to get to the camp on my own and get refunded afterwards?

You often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the alleys to take a look at a product. After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is out of price. Frustrated, you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers. There, you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to stay up even though your tired legs demand a seat. It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the cashier.
Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer but unluckily, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for. Instead, you keep thinking about the initial product you could not afford, resulting into more frustration and tiredness.

I think it depents if you are a man or a woman and now I have to say I am a woman and I enjoy it.
Honestly I had never a shopping tour which I didn't enjoy when I was.
I can remember one shopping tour which I had with a man and it was nightmare.
It was a fantastic sunny day and we went to Frankfurt and I really needed shows and it is not easy to buy shoes you have to choose carefully.
I tried ten pairs of shoes and with every shoe his mood got worse and worse and at the end we had a big fight about everything.
We left the shop without shoes, in horrible mood and we went home. Now he is my ex.boyfriend! Two days later I went back to the shop and I bought the shoes which I still wear. This was for me the only shopping tour which was not enjoyable.

There were maybe 50,000 spectators for this show, it was amazing. When the concert started I had if anybody threw bottles or something else on the scene. I also helped to serve people who would like drink, I was like a barman.

It is not always like that but we often see such a scene, even though shopping is becoming an entertainement not only for teenagers but also for adults.
We have more and more shops everywhere and they sale everything. Because of that, people's need has increase a lot nowadays. It is also the reason why we have all these new supermarkets. In the one hand, it is very enjoyable to go shopping because we can find a lot of things. Sometimes we need them and sometimes we don't but it is fun to buy new clothes, furniture and so one. In the other hand, the service in the shops or supermarkets has decrease a lot those last years. The shop assistants are not always nice and sometimes they don't even know a bit about what they sell.
In my opinion, shopping is not always enjoyable especially when there is too many people in there.","['W', 'M', 'W', 'MP', 'AGA', 'S', 'AGA', 'S', 'DV', 'AGN', 'AGV', 'TV', 'RA', 'ID', 'SX', 'ID', 'M', 'RC', 'RV', 'TV', 'RA', 'MQ', 'R', 'MP', 'AGV', 'R']",0,2,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0

Dear Kim,
I hope you are fine together with your family. I am going to answer your letter just now.
Last month I enjoyed a lot to help, really it was a very intresting experience, particularly to had deal with a young group of children from Latin America. It is increible!!, because I learnt some spanish words such us Hello, How are you? good bye?, What is your name, house, dog, cat, boy, girls etc, I am very happy that I promed to myself learn spanish this sommar at the Huntingdon College. Also another interesting things was to know about their culture, because all of them come from Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and Uruguay. At the concert they were very susscceful because they were very confident and I helped with the sound system and our equipment was extraordinary and the audience were fantastic. I hope one day you and me can travel to South America because I would like to introduce you my new friends.
Now I have to end this letter, so please call me if you want to see me next week.
Take care!!

Dear Ms. Helen Ryan:
I am writing this letter because I would like to express my happiness. This is the first time I won a prize in these kind of competitions so I would like to clear some doubts.
First of all, I would like to travel on July because I have a lot of work and my parents wish to see me in this month, so if it is possible to arrange the date it would be very nice.
Second, I use to go to Camps where they only used log cabins so I prefer if it is possible to be in tents, because it would be a original experience.
Third, I love playing basketball, I am a great player and I play with my University and I like to be playing all the time so this activity I will not missed. The other activity would be surf. I think is very cool and I want to learn.
Finally, I want to know what kind of clothe I will need and if have to take money for shops or markets.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Mrs Ryan,
I am very glad for receiving such a wonderful surprise, that I have won first prize. What a lovely opportunity to go to America!
About the information you asked me for, the most suitable month for me to travel would be July, since it is when I am free for traveling due to I won't have classes at school by that time. In the matter of accommodation I'd rather prefer log cabins, because I consider them better for resting and know people.
I also want to mention that it's great you have so many activities. The ones I consider I'm good at are painting and photography. I love nature and I'd like to record the Californian landscapes.
I have something I'd like to ask you. Do I have to take any special clothes with me? How warm is California in those days? Another thing, should I have to take my camera with me for the activity at the Camp? I'd appreciate any further information you can give me.
Looking forward to your repply.

You know that I love going to concerts, but being beging of all the show and in the staff as a member, was something I was always interested in. I never imagined how many people is involved in the organization! In the area of publicity we were about 50 guys, all of us investigating, calling to radio stations, organizing the reporters, specifying where the press would be for the interview that took place afterwards... yet, it was an incredible satisfation when everything finished just fine!

About accommodation, I would like to a long cabin because last year I had an accident and my back is enjure, so sleeping in a tent it would be painful for me.
I play basketball at university and my level is quite good but I am really enjoying is being a referee. Due to my back enjure, this year I could not train and play with my team, so I am not fit, it would be a good aidea to be a referee. I would like to swim everyday if is able.

I love shopping mainly when I am alone on when I am angry because I think it can help me to relax. When I got plenty of money sometimes I like spend a bit of it with some friends or buying a good present for my girl friend.
But if I haven't got enough money to spend or if I am sad shopping is not always enjoyable, because without money and sad is not a good idea to go to shopping.
Normally I spend money buying some new clothes that I like more and shoes I love new shoes.

For example: you need a lot of money each month for shopping, and a part of this money is only for buying the necessaryiest things like bread and other things to eat. I enjoy shopping when I can buy some clothes.
Also a problem while the shopping is that most there are so many people and a lot of traffic in all shopping-centres. All the people are there most on the same day because there are not a lot of other possibilities for shopping while the week for the employees.
I think one possibility is to buy your things on the internet, because then you have not to invest a lot of time for buying all this things, and they bring you the things at home In the end I think it is the best if you have the possibility to shop when there are not so many people because then you have enough time and you are not stressed.","['M', 'IJ', 'R', 'UD', 'M', 'R', 'MD', 'RP', 'RY', 'RN', 'R', 'UD', 'RN', 'RN', 'RP', 'X', 'UT', 'AGQ', 'RT', 'MD', 'MP', 'UD', 'RN']",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

Thank you for your letter. It was a wonderful surprise! I'm writing to give you the information you wanted.
Firstly, you asked me about the period I'd prefer to travel: For me, the only solution is July, because I've already something planned in August.
Concerning the accommodation, I'd prefer to spend my nights in a log cabin, because I've great difficulty sleeping in a tent.
You also mentionned the activities I'll be able to do. I chose tennis and golf. Althoug I've been playing tennis for five years, I can't say I'm a very good player. And I'm even worse at golf, because I've never been playing it before. But I enjoy discovering new activities! In addition to this, I would be grateful if you could send me information on these few details: what kind of clothes is required? How is the weather at this period of the year? And should I take some money with me? How much?
I hope you will be able to answer my questions.
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

If you are used to reading a lot, you know there are only a few books about which you can say: 'This is such a marvellous book I will want to read it again'. ""Cry Freedom"", from John Briley, is one of these books. But why should we read this book twice?
Firstly, the story takes place in South Africa, during the period of the Appartheid. The political and historical background is very interesting, but also complicated. I think that you can't understand all the links between the events whitout reading the book more than one time. And by understanding the book, you'll also be able to better understand what happens nowadays in a lot of countries.
However, I think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: Donald Woods and Steve Biko. Both of them symbolize courage, love of justice, fight for freedom, which makes them look like heroes. Just as the Greeks and the Romans, our modern society has mythes, and ""Cry Freedom"" is one of them.
To sum up, I think it's worth reading this book twice, both for a better understanding of our world, and for the symbolical meaning of the story.","['RT', 'UD', 'RP', 'S', 'S', 'R', 'MD', 'MD', 'RT', 'RN', 'S']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I like to do some activities in water and my favourite activity is swimming. Before I came England, I swam every weekend in my country even in winter, so I choose to do some swimming and sailing while I am at the camp.

What do students do now?
Lots of student normally have classes in the morning. And sometimes they do something in the library by themselves in the afteroon. For instance, reading, looking for some information or using computer.
What do they think about it?
The arts students want to learn another foreign language. Moreover, some foreign students hope there will be some English classes that aim to the examination.
Most of them want to do more activities in the afternoon.
Recommendations
Open some foreign language classes at part-time for the students who is interested in it.
Let foreign students do more excises about English to help them pass the exam.

Dear Ms Ryan,
I've just received the letter telling me that I've won first prize in your competition. I guess you can imagine how happy and excited I am at this time.
Here are the information about my stay at Camp California, that you asked my to complete:
For the date of the travel, I wonder if it would be possible in July because I'm going to pass a very important exam at the end of June. Two weeks in the USA would be a great occasion for me to relax after that.
You asked my to chose my accommodation between tents and cabins. I prefer sleeping in a log cabin (I made a very bad experience with tents while I was camping with friends last year)
The activities listed in your letter seemded. I choosed to do baskelball (I play in a club, I have a good level ) and photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in California).
Talking about California, I suppose that the weather is hot there in Summer. Could you please tell me if I have to take special clothes with me. If it's not two much to ask, could you also tell me how much money I should take with me for food or evening activities at the camp

After having visited shops during 10 hours and tried at least 2,000 shoes, I finally found what I was looking for. The shoes of my dreams (well designed and not too expensive) So I went back to the station, very proud of me with my sneakers in a white plastic bag and a great smile on my face.
I stayed that happy during the travel, thinking of how cool I would look on the playground with my brand new shoes on.
As I jumped off the train, I met a friend of mine. I immediately wanted to show him what I had bought to make him jealous. I took the white plastic bag and... Oh my god! There was no more plastic bag, I had forgotten it in the train!

Dear Madam,
I am writing in response to your letter, in which you told me I am the winner in your competition, and my intention is to try to give you all the information you may need according to your letter.
I would like to travel in July because I had another trip to Spain in August, that is the perfect month for me, otherwise I would not travel to Spain.
About accommodation, I would prefer tents instead of log cabins and the reason is I have never used tents and this could be a very exciting experience for me.
The two activities which I find better for me are swimming and sailing. I love the sea, that is why I became interested in those activities since I was ten, therefore I have a lot of experience in both.
Could you give me some advice about the weather in California?
Thank you very much for everything.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Dear Kim,
Thank you for asking about my latest good experience, I let you know what the important details were.
As you know I helped at a pop concert last month, I did things as unusual in me as cleaning instruments, organise people, and also look after the clothes of the artists. In fact everything was very easy, the instruments were already clean, and with the clothes my job was only wait there and give them what they asked for. Organise people involved, just a couple of things, say to people how to do the same as me and when.
The most exciting thing was to be able to speak to the singers, the whole environment, and of course to the listen to the Concert in the very first position.
All that I can say now is that I would do it again, I will never forget that day.
Looking forward to seeing you,

First of all you have to know that it wasn't a common pop concert, but a real open air festival. It isn't the first year that I work there. However this year wasn't like last year.
My job was as simple as selling ice-creams. You might say that it is quite boring, but it was so funny. Everybody was so relaxed; we were singing and dancing while selling ice-creams in our little van. Byran Adams himself bought me an ice-cream.
It was amazing experience. What I particularly liked about it was that the staff was like a big family. Everybody was ready to help each other. I was really impressed by this solidarity and friendship which is quite rare in Switzerland.

I'm pleased to receive your litter and realy happy that I won the first prize.
I would prefer to travel only on July because it's when my vacations start. I could even think about skyping's school. July is also good because the wethear is warm and I could enjoyed mor. I would prefer the tends because I'll be in touch with the nature and I could listen the sounds of the night. The two activities that I've chosen are Climbing and Photography. I've already climbed for four months on walls, indoor climbing. I think I can handde it very well. I've choosen Photography because I love to take pictures! I've never chose any classes or training but I think I can take very good pictures. I would like to learn more about developing films.
I have some questions myself, I would like to know:
. if I have to take special equipement to the activities that I've chosen
. If I have to take lots of clothes or is there a service to wash them.
. What kind of do I have to take
. If is there a phone, a fax or e-mail so I can be in touch with my familie?
. If I have to take any money. If yes how much?

I'm writing to you to tell you about a pop concert that happend here in São Rafael. Red Hot Chilli Pepers came here for a short time and they played at the ""Chedicard Hall"". It was realy cool because I did some backstage job. I helped with the with some paperwork, with the microphones, with the computers. I was everywher. I was kind of a ""handy girl"". I did a little bit of everything.. The best part was when the band arrived. I took lots of pictures, asked for authographs and I even gave them my cel phone number! They promissed me that they would call me some day, what I particulary doubt. Some thing that was also great was to watch the show from the back stage. It's an unique experience.

I acxepted it and I want to inform you that I can travel only on July because I have booked my anual leave that period. Also, I prefer to stay in tents because I have memories from my childhood. Every years my parents used to sent me for holidays at Camps on the mountains so I would like to stay for a while in the same accommodation, and environment. Also, I prefer swimming and painting. I started to learn how to swim when I was 7 years old. My parents brought me to the sea side every weekend so I was used to be inside the water all the seasons. I have taken part in races twice in my life, where I was successful. Also, I like painting from young age, and I have taken part in a public exhibition, where I won the first prize. I would like to ask how much money I should have with me, where can I keep them? What about the clothes, you don't mention anything. Do I need something special or ordinary clothes?

I would like to write about my experience that I had, when I enjoyed helping at a pop concert in my neighbourhood.
I am a member in the council team so I decided to help them at a pop concert that was organized in the last month. I helped them to prepare the room for the bads and I decorated the place for the singers. Also, I assisted them to choose the right instruments and to test them. It took a long time to testifite the speakers and the microphones. Unless this preparation, I also took part to the concert. I helped them to the music and to the songs. It was a quite difficult assiment but I got very good experience. I understood it when the concert had finished. The audients was excited and I cannot discribe my happyness. It was some thing that I didn't expect. Also, it happen first time in my life. I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were accompaning our songs. I enjoyed very much and I want to tranfere my enjoyment to you though this letter.

Actually, I would like to go to Camp California next July because I have got two weeks holiday then. I also will be pleased to stay in log cabins. My experience in camping is not so huge to stay in tents for 2 weeks.
Therefore, you asked me what activities I would like to join. Surfing is something that I have ever wanted to try. I have abosolutly no experience in it. Will it be possible to join a surf school? For the second activity I have chosen photography. I enjoy taking pictures of landscapes, I have also visited a photography course. So that my level is not beginners anymore.

Dear Kim,
Excuse me that I didn't write you sooner. As you know, I was fairly busy with my studying for my First Certificate.
The concert was absolute marvellous! So many happy people in the crowds, that the atmosphere was infectious. Anyway, what you wanted to know was what has been my job. Actually my job was not really stressful, but I had contact and access to all the famous Pop Stars. I had to bring them refreshments. That has been my dream since my childhood.
I was a little bit disappointed about their attitude. They didn't really appreciate my service. Some of them were quite rude. Apart from that, it was an amazing experience. Whatever, if you ever will have the opportunity to do something like this then do it without hesitating. I liked to see their way of life.
I hope you will write me very soon and I hope you know more about my concert experience in the backstage area.

I received your letter congratulating me on having won the first prize in your competition. I am extremely excited about the opportunity to go to your camp in the USA.
Firstly, I have to say that I am studying at University and I wonder if I could travel on July because of the exams I have on May. Apart from that I would not be able to travel there until the end of June.
It does not matter to me whether I stay in tent or log cabin, but I would prefer tent to be much more in contact with wild life and nature.
The activities I'd like to do most are playing basketball and Climbing. The first one because I have been played basketball since the age of twelve and the second one because there are not many places where to go climbing in my city.
Finally, I would ask you if I have to take my own clothes with me or you will provide me with some, and the amount of money needed.

I received your letter last week in which you told me that you want to hear about my experience at the pop concert.
It was terrible! We have a lot of problems from the beggining. The first one was the security. People in charge of security didn't arrive when they were supposed to. If it weren't a calm and quite public, we would have had troubles. Another problem was the band. They didn't want to play until the room were crowded. So that concert started an hour and a half latter.
Everything was all right during the perform, but at the end some espectators came up to the stage and made some damage to the band's instrument. The singer and the guitarist were so angry that they went out immediately leaving the public without the last part of the show.
As you can see, hardly anything went well, but the lights and the sound - both in wich I helped carrying things - were appropriate for the concert. Althought all these things, I gained a lot of experience and I could be near one of my favourite pop stars, which was the better experience I've ever had.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks for your last letter. I can understand why you are impatient to hear about my experience at the concert last month. I have met our favourite singer, Celine Dion! She is wonderful. But, first of all, let me explain to you what I did during the concert.
We arrived at the stadium the previous evening. The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help in anything they needed. Firstly, we were asked to clear the stadium, especially the seats and surroundings. When we finished clearing, some of us offered our help to enter the sound equipment into the stadium. They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the scenary was being prepared for the concert.
And then, when all was prepared, Celine appeared in the scenary to make some sound tests. I was astonished. It was incredible! I was so near her! When she finished the tests, I went to meet her, I told her I was very happy for staying there and having helped at the concert, and I asked her an authograph. She gave it to me with a great smile and gave permission to take a photograph of both of us. And she dedicated the photograph to me!
I still believe it has only been a dream! I am willing to show you the authograph and the photograph.
Please, make sure you can come next weekend. We will be able to talk bout the concert and we will listen together to the last Celine Dion's C.D.
Let me know if you are going to come so that I prepare the bedroom to put you up.
Please, come!

First, I would like to thank you for offering me this wonderful prize. For a long time I wish I came to Camp California, and now my dream is about to become true.
There is no much time left in my timetable in August since I will have to work then, so I would rather come in July. Concerning the accomodation, I would prefer to sleep in a log cabin, because to sleep in a tent would remind me of the bad experience I had in Ireland because of the weather...
Since this stay at Camp California is a good occasion to discover new activities, I would like to sail and climb, but I am a beginner in both activities.
Then, I would like to know what kind of clothes I will need there, and if I have to bring a lot of money. I am looking forward to hearing from you.

I apologize for not having written this letter sooner, but as you probably now, I was actually really busy because of the pop concert. What a great experience that was! I will remember it for a long time because of two reasons.
The first one is that the band I have helped, although it hasn't met success yet, is really good. When they are on stage, during the repetitions, they are able to play a music that completely moves me. In a few months, when they are famous, I could say: ""You know. I already know them, I have even helped them at one of their concert.""
Moreover, the work I've had to do, apart from carrying material, was essentially to sell tickets for the concert, which has allowed me to meet a lot of nice people and to become friend with some of them. Even though my entire body aches ( material was quite heavy) and I am tired, I wouldn't call it a work! I am looking forward to hearing from you.

I would like to begin this composition by saying that, not for everyone is shopping the same. For some people it's great fun, but for some other it's a "" must "".
In my opinion, shopping is like relaxing. I like to go very often, to look around and to buy some new clothes. As long as I am not searching for something specific. When I must buy something, I usually can't find it and then the shopping become a nightmare.
On the other hand, when you go with someone else shopping, and you both want to see and buy different things, it can also be boring and uninteresting. Then it is perhaps better, when you make an appointment in one hour and everybody enjoys the shopping alone.

I would be able to travel only after the end of my exams which are taking place in June. So, I think that July would suit me best.
As far as accomodation is concerned, I would prefer sleeping in a tents. I have been travelling every summer since I was eighteen years of age and this type of accomodation is part of the ritual.
I would enjoy a lot playing tennis because it is a sport I love and I am really good in it. In addition I would love to follow the photography classes eventhough I have never tried to take a picture before.

I got your letter yesterday and I was really glad to hear from you... it's been ages since you last wrote to me! I've done so many thinks and between them I went to Glastonbery (as you know)!
It lasted three days and I've had the best fun of my life. I went as a voluntier staff in order to go for free. I had to help the Green Peace teems to recycle everything we could.
We were more or less two hundred students doing the same job. Our duty was to work eight ours each day and then we were free to enjoy the rest of the day as we liked.
The accomodation and the food were part of the contract... everything free. They provided us tents and also a VIP pass in order to get food.
Oh my God!!! It has been the best experience you can Imagine. I met lots of nice and cool people, and what I most enjoyed was the crazy atmospher of the hole thing. No matter how hard we had to work, everyone had always humor and a positive mood.
So, I'll sign off now and I hope you'll write soon.

Firstly I would like to thank you for your prize. This travel enjoys me because I never go to USA.
Secondly I am going to answer your questions. I can travel only July because I study in an ingenior's school in France and in Summer we have holidays since July.
I prefer to live in tents, where it is easier to make contacts with other people than in log cabins. When I travel I don't often sleep in hotel, I prefer tents and also I can meet people, who lives in the country.
For the activities I would be very happy if I could play golf. That is a sport that I always want to practise but in France it is to expansive. So if I have this opportunity, I don't want to fail it. I would like to photograph too. There are so much monuments in California and so I will remember these holidays with my photographies.
Could you send me more informations about clothes to take with? Finally I would like to ask you, if I need some money because you say all accomodation and travel costs are paid for.

Last month, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert. It was marvellous!!!
I was in the backstage, so I could speak with the singer before the concert. During half an hour he explained me, how he feel in France.
I had to serve glasses of water to the group before and during the concert, so I had a lot of contact with them. They are very gentle. After the concert, I went to eat with them in a restaurant near the stadium, where they had played.
What I particularly liked about this experience is that I saw that famous people are like us and have the same interest.
I think that this experience is something that you have to live too. Perhaps in the next concert we will go together. I will give you news about it.
I hope you will answer my letter and say me if you are interesting in my proposition. I send you with my letter a photo of the singer, what he give me.
See you later.

Shopping sounds very enjobleable and fantastic for women. You can find a lot of interesting things which you unexpected. Some people enjoy window shopping, but some people enjoy spending their money on their clothes or shoes. Nowadays in a family shopping isn't women's job.
In other hand, after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card. For instance, you want to buy everything which you saw, and after that, you don't know how much you have spent. If you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet which you are looking at some interesting things. It will be very awful.

I rather prefer to stay in tents because I like to stay as closest as possible to nature, it makes me feel better.

I would like to ask about somethings which might be necessary for me to take with, like what kind of clothes should I take, should I take my own surf board, and what about money, should I bring some with me?

Dear Kin,
As you know, I had a great experience last month giving a helping hand for the band called RAMONES.
It was a breeze to help them and was very cool as well, those guys really know how to play rock.
I had only to stay behind the drummer suppling them with water whenever they wanted.
When the band had just started to play, lots of girls started to jump the faints getting very close to them, some of the girls started to take their clothes of, which was the best part for me, but some of securities went there and took them away.
Afterwards, the Ramones had a short break and when they went back from their break they've just went of.
I had a really nice time with them even tought I would've prefered to stay at the front with the others people, but anyway it was a great experience for me, I holp to be able to help them next year.
I holp you've enjoed my experience, and I hope to hear from you soon.

I received your letter and would be glad to travel two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. but I will only be able to go in July for in June I will be in Austria with a friend and in August I have rented an appartment with my family.
I would rather be accommodated in a tent because I already have the necessary material for camping. While I am at the Camp I would like to play tennis and do photography. I play very well tennis since I have played it since I was a child but I am a novice in photography and I would like to try it as I have always been interested in it.
I would like to ask you a few questions:
What kind of clothes should I bring?
Will you give clothes for activities?
How much money should I bring there?

Sometimes the seller might even ignore you as he or she is talking to another sellor.
For example, you walk into a shoe store. Two sellers are talking and although they saw you enter, they continue their discussion so you have to interrupt them. Then, one of them serves you but half listens to you because he or she is still talking to the other sellor. There is nothing more disagreable than that.
Also, when you find a nice sellor and he shows you lots of objects, when you don't find what you want, you feel sad for him or her because you made him or her lose his or her time so you feel obliged to buy something. All this to say that shopping may seem enjoyable but often is not.","['RV', 'S', 'RN', 'S', 'RN', 'RN', 'S', 'RN', 'MP', 'RN', 'S', 'S', 'RN', 'S', 'RY', 'RV', 'MP', 'MV']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am very happy to have won the first prize in your competition. It is a wonderful surprise.
I can go to the Camp California only in July, because I have school in June and I must work in my father's bookshop in August.
At the Camp I want to live in a log cabin. I do not like the tents; one can find insects in them and they are not as comfortable as log cabins.
For the two activities I can choose, I would like to play tennis: I have some experience in this sport, because I played tennis during seven years and it is still my favourite activity. I would try to do some painting, too, but I have never painted.
I would like to know what sort of clothes I have to take (if it is going to rainy or to be sunny) and how much money I must have with me. Could you tell me what sort of material I will have to bring to do the activities?

Do you know last week I have been to a pop concert to help my uncle, who is the director of the stadium of Lugano. It was very interresting, because I did different things. I cooked a meal for the artists, I spoke with the manager of Bruce Springsteen and I helped a technician to install his material: the lights.
The best part of the day was after the concert, when I met the group ""U2"". I was very excited, because this is my favourite group: I'm always hearing their songs. I took some photographies and I'll show them to you when you come next week
I had a talk with Santana, the best guitarist in the world, too. He's quite old, but very attractive. I would like playing guitar like him.
What a great day it was. The next concert is on 19th June and I will be here.
See you soon.

Firstly, I will be happy to play tennis because I used to play this sport with my village club and earned a few competitions.

We can hear many items people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping. Is a kind of relief for them.
Of course it is good to buy things for ourselves, like clothes, jewelery, anything. Specially if we don't have to worry about money. It's good to walk around looking all the news in the stores.
But, sometimes, go shopping can have other effects on you. It can stress you. For example, when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around. When you can't find what you are looking for anywhere. When you buy something you were looking for a long time and, when you arrive at home, you discover some deffect on it and have to go back to the store to complain. It is just terrible when the sellers don't treat us well sometimes we just give up and never come back to that store. And, a really bad thing is, after buying everything you wanted and feeling very happy with all that, you realize that you spent more money than you should...
So, after all this, I suggest that before you decide to go shopping to feel better you should think of all the problems you may have while you are shopping or the big headache you can have after it. It would probably be better if you just go shopping when you really need and, to relax, you can talk to a friend, read a book or listen to good music.
Remember: go shopping is not always the better choice. It can be very unpleasant sometimes.","['UN', 'MA', 'S', 'RY', 'MT', 'RN', 'FV', 'S', 'RN', 'MP', 'MV', 'TV', 'TV', 'FV', 'FJ']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Kim,
I hope you are fine. You know, last month I helped at a pop concert and I am sure you want to know some details.
My first task was to open the doors to let in all the fans of Britney Spears. I stood at the entry and theire I had to check the tickets. Two girls came together and they wanted to go in with only one ticket for both! I had to tell one of them, that she had to leave. She started crying. Such a poor girl. At this moment I didn't like my position.
My second task was that I had to look in all the bags of the fans to collect ""dangerous"" items, I saw really funny things like teeth-bruches in the bags. This part of my work was really funny and I enjoyed it.
Summing up I can say that it was a fantastic day, because Britney sang so beautiful and the performance was also super.
I hope you can imagine how a wonderful day it was for me.

In my opinion, women are really enjoying shopping.. However, we are going to change traditional system to the ""e-shopping"".

In conclusion, I believe that shopping only waste time for human life..","['CE', 'S', 'UV', 'U', 'SX', 'R', 'TV', 'R', 'M', 'UD', 'MP', 'RT', 'R', 'MV', 'MD', 'UT', 'L', 'RT', 'FV', 'TV', 'UT', 'FV', 'UT', 'CL', 'RP', 'RN', 'FV', 'U', 'MP', 'R', 'RP', 'TV', 'MD', 'MD', 'RN', 'RJ', 'AGV', 'U', 'R']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,5,0,0,0,1,2,2,0,2,0,0,1,0,1,3,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0

I am replying. As you asked in the letter, I will write everything I need to know about the travel.
First of all, I would like to travel on July, because during the other months, I will be studying, preparing myself for other exams or I will be out travelling somewhere else with my relatives.
I have been thinking and I decided I would prefer to stay in tents, simply because it's a new experience and I would like to try everything new. Also, it seems more dangerous. For the two activities I have to choose, I decided to choose a new activitie that I have never done before, which is Sailing, so I am a totally begginer at this. The other activitie is Photography, I am not an expert, but I know how to use a camera, all I want is to improve my knowledge.
Finally, I need to know what kind of clothes and how many I should pack. Is there any place that I can wash my clothes? I also needed some information on the money I will take. Do you have any kind of souvenirs that I can buy? Do I need to take any money at all?
I will be waiting a reply.

I'm sorry it took so long for me to answer your letter, but I've been too busy with my school, papers and everything. But now I found some time to tell you everything about the pop concert I helped.
There were about a hundred people that wanted to help, but only two would be chosen. When they said my name, I couldn't believe it! All I could think was ""Oh my god, I'm gonna be talking and helping the most famous pop bands!"" I was so excited that I couldn't believe.
When I arrived to help them, they welcomed me and were so nice with me that it seemed we had known each others in ages! They weren't those kind of people that think they're gods.
I helped them organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and they even let me play with their guittars! That was so great!
I don't know exactly how I felt, sometimes I wake up and think it was nothing but a dream. I hope you liked everything I said and I hope an answer as soon as possible.

I am very pleased about the prize I just won in your competition. Thank you for choosing me. Here is some further information about myself and a few enquirement.
First of all, I am sorry to say that I could only travel in July. As my family's new restaurant is about to open in August, I need to help with the restaurant, which is expected to be rather busy.
Secondly, I would like to live in log cabins while I am staying at the camp. I had bad experience last time I lived in a tent. I was attacked by a been and it still gives me nightmares!
As for selecting two activities, basketball and surfing are definitely on my list. I spend one third of my spare time playing basketball. As a result, I have an important position in our local basketball team. Surfing was a fresh sport to me which I took up recently. It is really fasinating to challenge waves. I wish I could learn more so that I could enjoy it more in the future.
In addition what kind of clothes shall I bring with me? How much money is appropriate to carry?
I look forward to hearing from you.

I really wish you were there with me at that one of the exciting nights in my life. Now I can't wait to tell you every detail. Are you ready?
That was a pop concert of Steps in M.E.N Arena. And I was initially employed to be an entrance assistant whose job was to keep the queue under control as well as keeping the area clean.
A few minutes after the concert began, a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking wether everything is going well according to the timetable, if something comes up, she should inform other staff. I was then taken in to cover her job. I couldn't find my feet at first as I was so nervous. I was given lots of paper with many different time on it. I did manage to ""study"" them though, thanks to other staff. They were very helpful and nice. They patiently explained to me my job even so they were fairly busy themselves. Then I found it was not as complicated as I though before. And I guess I did a good job as everything was getting on quite well.
I saw all the members of the band backstage, how did they change their make-up, hairstyle etc. They were even talking jokes with me and other staff. I was impressed when they kept saying "" thank-you "" to the staff. Indeed, they can not succeed without their help, can they? I was lucky to have this chance and able to know how they work behind the scene. All in all, it was a once-a-lifetime experience.

I am glad that I have won first prize in your competition. I have been very surprised winning. You ask me in your letter when I would like to travel. The answer is the following one: I only can travel July because I have to work all August. I can take holidays only the month of July. You ask me if I prefer to sleep in tents or log cabins. I prefer the tents because I never use such kind of accommodation. I have choosen the two following activities. First one is Tennis and second one is sailing. I played tennis for many years. I have even done competitions. I like a lot this game. I have choosen sailing because I would like to try a new sport. I love water but I never try this sport before.

Shopping is not always enjoyable because of different problems.
The first thing is the place of shopping. Sometimes you have to go far away from home to do your shopping and it takes a lot of time. The second thing is that you need to go shopping when the supermarkets are open. Many people work late and they do not have enough time to go for shopping. The third thing is the trouble of full shops. Everybody do their shopping at the same moment and often in the same place. It is almost a battle to buy different things and to go paying those things. People are often nervous and agressive. Sometimes you can see fights between two men or women.

The things I did were: Prepearing and controling the equipment, I had to clean all the stadium, make sure that all the lights were in perfect condition, that the singers were confortable and relaxed, etc.

I have safely received your letter bringing the good news. I wish that I could describe how ecstatic I felt when I found that I won the competition. Here I enclose some information which you requested in the letter I received.
I think that the best and most convenient time for me to travel would be in July. This is because it falls on my holidays and that it is also summer in America. This trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays, as well as allow me to gain valuable knowledge and experience.
Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent. It will let me get up and close with nature, and experience life in the wild. Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember.
Camp California certainly has plenty of activities to do. However, among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best. I have much experience in swimming and have represented my school before. As for tennis, I find it very enjoyable and have gone for proper lessons.
Last before least, I wonder if you could inform me of the clothes I should bring to America. As I have not been there before, I am rather unsure of what to wear. I am also trying to decide on the amount of money I should bring. Will I be going out much, or just stay in Camp California all the time?
I hope that I haven't taken up too much time. Thank you for this exciting news. I can't wait to go on this adventure of a lifetime!

How are you in London? I hope the weather is holding up. I hear that it can be terrible at times. Guess what? Last month, I got to help out at a pop concert. It was a fantastic experience.
The concert was held at our school hall. All the students had to help to brighten up the place, and boy did we work. I helped to decorate the walls. My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green. It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result.
Besides that, I also helped to do banners and signs to inform other people about the concert. It was hard work, I had to saw wood and paint all day long. Several other students helped me out, and we managed to make some eye-catching advertisements.
I also helped in the lighting and studio equipment. I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls. This produced a stunning effect during the concert. I also got to fix new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall.
I enjoyed fixing the studio equipment in particular. It gave me the chance to expand my knowledge and gain new skills in electronics. On the whole, it was a fun experience to work with friends, fixing bulbs, attaching lights and adding speakers.
I really enjoyed myself and I hope that you can have the chance to experience this too. I hope that you can write to me soon. I look forward to reading what you have to say. Bye for now!

Dear Hellen,
Thank you very much for your letter that I received yesterday. I am very happy that I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at camp California in USA. Also I am pleased, that I don't have to pay any expenses.
I would like to travel end of July. In June I have other arrangements, such as my school exams and my birthday. It is convenient for me the last two weeks of July. After my school exams I will have time to prepare myself for the trip.
In your letter you are asking me to chose which accomodation I prefer. I would like very much to stay in tents. Last year I stay in tents with some friends in England and I really enjoyed it. Summer time the weather is good and I don't see any problem anywhere I will stay.
During my time in California, I would love to have the chance of some leisure activities such as swimming. It is my favourite sport. I am good and fast at swimming. Another sport I love is basket ball. Hopefull I will meet some other girls in the same sport. So we all play as a team.
My final question is this. Can you let me know if there is any facilities for washing my clothes If not I will bring with me enough to last for two weeks. Please give me a rough idea how much spending money I will need.

An argument in favour of this statement is that shopping is very tiring. You can be walking for hours and finally you can't find anything that you like.
Also, you can spend hours trying to decide between a wonderful blue trousers or a beautiful black dress, for example.
I think that shopping is even more boring when you go with a friend and you have to give her some advice. It can be a very stressful situation because in some moments you don't know what to say.
In my opinion shopping could be a 'dangerous' activity because you may spend more money in some clothes that you can afford. I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping. Despite shopping is boring I think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several clothes and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment.
So, shopping is not enjoyable, but necessary.","['M', 'UT', 'DY', 'RT', 'SX', 'FV', 'MP', 'R']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition and want to thank you for that very interesting competition.
I am only available in July because I am studying in an engineering school and I'll work until the end of June. But no problem for July!
You asked me which accommodation I would prefer between tent and log cabin. I am used to spend summer holiday in tent and I like it, but why not try log cabin? But it doesn't matter if there is no log cabin available... Now let's speak about the most interesting activity: sport. I would be very pleased if I could practice tennis and surfing. In fact, I practice tennis and I am quiet good at, and it will the occasion to train myself surfing is completely unknown for me and I hope that I will like it. But if I don't try it I will never know if I like it or not!
Finally, I wanted to know if I need money and how many, and if there is a dry cleaning.
I look forward to hearing from you.

I am very happy with your letter that I received last week. I'm too excited and I have to tell you about a fantastic experience that I had last month.
I suppose you know about ""Portugal Pop Concert"" that happened here in Rio de Mouro last month, aren't you?
It was a marvellous concert and there were about 100,000 people there. I worked as a receptionist in the Vip room and I needed to look very happy during all time, what wasn't very difficult. You will can't believe how many famous people I known. I met Madonna and could talk with her for ten minutes. It was a dream and she was amazing.
I didn't tell you, but I helped in this concert just by a chance. A friend of me gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place. I said ""yes"" and I am sure it was the best decision of my life.
Of course I was very tired at the end of five days because of some stressed situations. However, these days were unforgatable to me.

The best way to go shopping is when you think in advance what you really want to buy and. If people would think about it BEFORE going shopping, they would not have a headache when they go home and realize they did not want what they bought.
Shopping can be an awful adventure when people want to buy all their presents the day before Christmas, for example. There is no way to find good prices! Shops are crowded, items are of bad quality and people are buying without thinking.
The worst time to go shopping is when people feel under stress or when they feel unsatisfied in their personal lives. It may seem relaxing at the beginning, but if they take their credit cards with them, the stress will increase when they have to pay for the bills!!
Recommendations?

I will be very happy to travel on july because in that date I am going to have my holidays, so I will not have to ask permition from my work. At the same time, on, so it would be nice to celebrated there.
I will prefer to have my accomodation in a tent, couse in that way I can feel more clouse to the nature, and I can remember when I was a scout girl. Sleeping in tent is much more exiting and than a log cabin.
At the camp I will like to choose two activities, Painting and Singing, I love painting, in the university I studied art for two years, but now I don't have much time to paint couse I work in a bank and I have a baby. So I will be very happy to improve my art in the camp. The reason of my option for singing is couse I feel embarrest about my voice, so maybe I could get it better.
I will like to have more information about the prices of the clothes and souvenires.

When I received your letter, I was very surprised and happy because I don't remember that I did this competition.
First I can travel only in July because, I will finish school at the end of June and I will pass my exam in Septemeber; so I have to repeat it a lot during the month of August.
To answer your second question, I choose the accomodation in tents because I like to sleep outside.
For the activities, I choose the Golf and the Surfing ( that wasn't easy to decide which activities I will do, cause almost choice interested me)
I tried the golf twice, I'm really bad but I hope to do much progress.
I never did surfing, but every time I see surfing on television I find this magic.

I would like to travel only July because I would be in schools holydays and the weather is hot and the sea's temperature is less cold than in winter. I would like to travel in July to be sure it would not rain during the trip which is boring?! And when the sun is shining you are relax and you feel good.
. I would prefer tents to sleep at Camp California because it is fun to sleep in tents to compare in a house. You are in communication with the nature and you can hear the insects. And we only need to sleep and not to cook or watch T.V... It is very nice to stay in tents wich are strong and confortable.
. From the list below, the two activities I will choose are Tennis and sailing. Tennis because I play Tennis and I am classed 15-5. I like very much Tennis because it is and physical sport. And you need strategie to win the match. It is nice to play tennis outside in the court when the weather is hot. But you can't play if there is too much wind, the ball becomes incontrolable!
Windsurfing because I pratise it for a long time. You can do it alone. I like windsurfing because it is a sport of speed and like skiing, surfing. you need technics to move the windsurf. You must know how to use the wind and!
I would like to ask you questions: Must I take?
Is there a washing machine at Camp California?

In fact, shopping is not always enjoyable because sometimes you want to buy articles but you don't have enough money!
You don't find anything interesting in the shop.
You can hesitate to choose an article. Which is the best article to take? The seller can be not very nice and watch you all the time. You don't find your size or the good. The article can be too expensive.
It looks fragil and it could break easily.
Your must test several shops and compare the price, the quality of the articles. So you must walk all the day or go by car. And the weather must be fine if you walk in the town.

About the acomodations I would like to stay in a log cabin because I am used to stay in it when I travel.
The activities that I want to do in the camp are Basketball and Surfing. Basketball is the sport that I really like because I am very tall as well as I use to play it very well. On the other hand I don't know almost nothin about surf but I would like to learn and to practise the sport because I think it cool.
There is one thing I would like to ask you. It's about how much money I will need to go out at night, to spend with food and this kind of thing.

There are people that loves going to the shopping. They live, work and only think about it. They are addicted in buying things. Some doctors say that buy without control is a disease and I agree with them because I have a friend who is a compulsory buyer. He can't stop buying things, he spend all his money buying things that he sometimes don't use. I think this one bad side of shopping and many people have this problem.

Dear Mrs Ryan,
Thank you very much for your letter. I was really surprised and very happy when I read that I have won the first prize. First of all because I have never been to California and second because it's the first time I have ever won something.
The only time that is possible for me to travel is July, because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday.
For my stay in California I would prefer because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my live here in Greece.
The activities I would like mot are climbing and surfing. In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say, that I am quite good in climbing. But I have never 'surfed' in my live, so that is an activity I have to.
Last but not least there are some things I would like to know: What kind of wheather do you have in California? Is it very hot? What kind of clothes should I bring with me?
And what about money? How much money Should I take with me? Are there any activities which are not included? And my last question: how many persons are going to stay in each tent.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Yours sincerely","['RP', 'MA', 'R', 'DN', 'W', 'SX', 'UP', 'RT', 'DN', 'RV', 'S', 'RP', 'L', 'MP']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

First of all because of the big variety in the store. Very often you don't know what to buy because we don't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from, not, we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike, adidas or Fila.
And very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want.
Another cause is that shops and stores are often overcrowded. Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people.
And many people are in a hurry, so don't wonder if other people have not tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping cars.
Of course there are a lot of other causes why shopping isn't always great fun, but the last cause, which is very important for me is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal. That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where noone has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me, no one to talk to and noone to complaine. That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in little stores, where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complaine about.","['RQ', 'RJ', 'RP', 'DJ', 'SX', 'RP', 'RN', 'RV', 'X', 'MD', 'RN', 'RN', 'RN', 'MP', 'RP', 'RV', 'RA', 'RP', 'S', 'MT', 'RJ', 'S']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,4,4,1,0,2,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The concert I helped last week was the greatest experience I've ever had.
I mainly gave them a hand in setting up the stage. You know, although I'm a pop music fan, I'd never had any idea how. First, they asked me to put those instruments on the stage. I left the on the left side (it should be on the other side). Before opening, the pop star found the mistake, otherwise it would be a disaster.
The performer, Paul, is a big music name at the present. But I'd never met him before. This time, I saw him in person. I told him I loved his songs, he was very happy. Then, we stroke a lovely conversation. Afterwards, he gave his pen for my enthusiasm.

Dear Kim,
Here I am, writting you to tell everything about my wonderful experience at the concert. You can't imagine How much did I enjoy that.
I started early in the morning helping to carry the stuff from the trucks to the place where the band played, I help with the music stuff like speakers, mics, lights, sound, etc. And later the band arrived and played two or three times before the concert started. And I was helping them fixing the last details.
When the concert started I was preparing some drinks for the band because when the concert finished they were very tired and tersty.
After the concert I only help with tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean. Later the band was talking to me, I could get their new album free, and some other souvenirs from the band.
But the thing that particulary liked me was that I could do all kind of things just in one day and I could feel different emotions.
So, that's everything that I can tell you, I enjoy a lot and I hope to have another experience like this.","['IV', 'MT', 'MA', 'RP', 'UV', 'TV', 'RN', 'MP', 'UD', 'RP', 'TV', 'DJ', 'MN', 'TV', 'FV', 'MP', 'R', 'TV', 'S', 'TV', 'UT', 'AS', 'FN', 'RP', 'TV', 'MA']",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,6,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

First of all, about your enquires, the only time suitable for me to travel is in July. The reason is that my academic year starts in August therefor I need to be here.
Secondly, I would rather stay in a tent, there's no further reason is just that would be a new experience for me and I'm very excited about it.
I am very keen on photography so I definetely will choose this as one of my activities during the camp. The other thing I'd love to do is sailing. I have got some experience already and I'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore I simply love sea-sports and their chalenges.

My dear friend I hope you are very well and just as happy as I am. You must remember me telling you about the pop concert, well now that it's over I have time to tell you everything about it.
The concert was a huge success, lots of people came and enjoyed the music.
I am very proud of myself because of the way I managed the whole experience, although there were moments when I thought I wasn't going to be able to cope with all the pressure. Especially when the musicians arrived, they can be very demanding people and sometimes they came up with very odd requests. For example once they wanted mineral water of a certain French label, which was impossible to get.
My tasks were very especifics. I had to help with the layout of the stage, which was very complicated, because there are so many cables, and things going on at the same time. After that part was fully-functioning I moved on to work in the back stage.
I really enjoyed working with those people, they are all very professional although they may look a bit eccentric sometimes.

I'll be taking an English Examination at the end of June and I think it would be a good idea if I can travel in July because it's the only month I can spend abroad this year.
In the letter you said that accommodation provided can be either tents or log cabins. I would prefer to stay in tents so that I will have the chance to be in contact with the nature as well as the scenery around.
Another thing I would like to choose from the activity list is singing (because I take part in a chorus at school) and photography. I'm really good taking pictures, it's a way I have to express my feelings.
I wonder if you could send me more information about what kind of clothes have we bring. Do you think you could also let me know how much money we will need during our stay at the Camp.

In order to celebrate the 125 aniversary of the city, the Coun Council organised an open air concert. It was a summer night and all the citizens, as well as tourists, had the opportunity to attend. The pop band ""Five"" arrived into town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also the stages and sound. I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager. I couldn't believe when he said: ""O.K. if you want to help, here is a list of what you can do."" My job was to leave some leaflets on shops, restaurants and streets.
Working with this band was an experience I will never forget. What I really enjoyed was been part of the staff.

I have just received your letter, and I am very happy about this. Thanks very much!
I think I would like to travel only on July because I've just finished my course at that time, and I can have a short holidays. It will be very nice for me.
Accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins, I think I prefer both of them, because I've never been there before, and never heard of these two. I am very interested in both but, I can just choose one, I think I will choose log cabins, it's sounds good and if I have time, maybe I can go to tents next time (maybe next year.)
When I am at Camp, I will choose singing and photography I can sing classic music and pop music, like rock & roll. Maybe TITANIC. My mum liked me singing this song. And I can also make very good photography, because I learned this in China two years ago.
Another thing is I would like to ask you some questions about journey, What's the weather like? What kind of clothes shall I take? and how much does it cost per night live in a Hotel? Thanks for your help.

A lot of people enjoy shopping very much, me too. But sometimes shopping is not very enjoyable.
Firstly, I am a student, I don't have job, so, I have to asked money from my parents. I can't asked too much that's very bad for my parents. When I go shopping. I alway feel shame because I spend my parents money. ( although I got part-time job, it just enough to pay my rent.)
Secondly, if you live in a big city, the things always expensive. You should spend more money on buying clothes and food, you will very happy when you buy it, but, when you come back home take out you purse, you must be feel sad, you purse nearly empty, (when you don't have enough money.)
Sometimes, when you shopping, you will see a lot of things that you like, and you can't buy it, you will feel very sad maybe. funny isn't it?
Another thing is when you shopping in a busy street, seem like oxford st in London. a lot of thief there, they will steal you money, that's so dangerous.

In my opinion shopping is a very good that's give you more opportunity to enjoy yourself. I don't understand why men don't like shopping at least they say that.
Despite the fact that it love shopping I have to agree that it is not ""always"" enjoyable. Sometimes you go out and you can't find something special or there are a lot of people there. It's boring.
You shouldn't go shopping when the shopps are so busy because its so boring. If you want to buy a Christmas present buy it some days before Christmas.
Another point is now you don't need to go out just for shopping. You can buy a lot of products by Internet.
I believe if you choose the best way or the best day to go shopping you will love it.

These days people have been shopping more often than they used to. Sometimes shopping can be a stressing experience though people think of it as an enjoyable part of their lives.
First of all, shopping can be a good thing if it is a possibility to forget about all the problems you have, even if it is just for a moment. It relieves you from the pressure of life while you are looking for something to buy.
On the other hand, sometimes you can get really nervous about shopping like when you have to deal with unhelpful shop assistants. It is a very common fact these days and you have to be patient if you really want to buy something.
Furthermore, sometimes you can not find a variety of goods and you eventually buy a low quality product.

I recived your letter and I am very excited about the camp.
I would like to go in July I don't mind wich two weeks but it has to be that month because in June I still in school and in August I'am going on holiday with my family.
I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I think it's different from where I sleep every night so I would apreciate it if there are still tents available.
One of the activities I would prefer to do is Climbing, I haven't done a lot of it but I've always found it interesting and I think this would be a good opportunity to become better in it. The other activity I would like to take is tennis, I'm quite good at it and I have been practising for four years.
I would like to know what type of clothes I should take and also if I need to take money with me.

Dear Kim,
Hello girl how are you doing this days. I am great especially last weekend in the concert of Backstreet Boys. It was so exciting.
They were giving two concerts one in Friday and the other one in Saturday they invited me to go on friday. This is what happened: when I arrive they told me that I was helping in backstage with the scenery, then the group arrived, we chat for like 15 minutes then they had to go on stage. Here is where the good part starts, I was doing the courtines (opening and closing) when Nick came to me and ask me to go on stage with him, my heart started beating very hard. The next second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing with The Backstreet Boys. I had a great time that day.
Well I have to go now. Hope to hear from you later on.

I am writing to reply on your letter concerned about the holidays at Camp California in the U.SA as a first prize in the competition which I fortunately won last month.
First of all, I want to know if it is possible to travel in July because during that month I will be free from the school's activities so my parents just let me go if I do not have to miss any of my classes.
About the activities that I have to choose, I have to say that it is quite difficult for me because I really like sports, but I think the best option is swimming because I have been practicing it during 5 years so I want to keep on it. The other activity that I chose is painting, I am not as well as I want, nevertheless I think I can inprove my skills during this course.
I would rather tends than log cabins for accommodation because the last summer I had the great opportunity to in a log cabin and now I want to know the other one. I am sure it will be thrilling to stay near the nature and at the same time, it would be a new experience for me.
I would like to know how is the weather in California during the summer to bring with me appropiate clothes and the last thing I need to know, is the amount of money that I have to bring with me.
If you need more information, please do not hesitate on writing me.

Re: Suggestions for the film.
Introduction
To make easier and faster this report, it was necessary to make a questionarie which was gave out in the school.
After collecting the answers, I obtained the following results:
1- It would be a good idea to film the computer centre, the room and the library because as everybody knows, they have very good equipment and also they are comfortable places helping them to improve their English on their own.
2 - They also think, that filming some of the lessons that they usually have, known as ""one-to-one"" lessons, people who see this video, will be interested on knowing more about the school because a few English schools have this sort of classes.
3 - The least but not the last, a lot of students (almost 85%) think that the extra-activities organised by the social programme, has became really exciting, so they suggest filming these activites during the weekend, for example ""the full day in Oxford"" because for those that did not have the opportunity to go there, could see how great it was and then they can attend the next time. However, 15% thougth that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying and they mentioned it as not really important.
Conclusion
As you can see, my clasemates and almost everybody in the school are happy with the facilities and activities that we have. Despite of being almost 300 students, the answers were quite similar.
I do recommend to pay attention to the food in the cafeteria because even though it was not the main reason of this report, they also wrote complaning about that.

I have just received your letter and I am really looking forward to going to this trip. Here is some information you asked for and also a few questions.
I would like to travel in July, as it will be summer, and the weather will be nicer. Accommodation in log cabins would be better for me, because they are more comfortable.
One of the activities I will do is tennis, but I am just a beginner, so I would like someone to teach me. The other activity will be photography, which I am very good at.

Many people enjoy going shoppings meeting friends and mainly spending their money, but sometimes shopping can be a terrible experience.
The good side of this activity is that it can be, provided you are not in a hurry.
On the other hand, when the shops are crowded (for instance, just before Christmas), going shopping can be very stressful, as you cannot walk and have to bear endless queues. Another problem is the shortage of trolleys in supermarkets, which is very common when they are full of people. As if these were not enough, there are always impolite assistants, who make your day even worse.
Summing up, going shopping can be a relaxing activity if you choose the right day, but be aware of how dangerous it can be for your patience.","['CN', 'MP', 'R', 'R', 'RV', 'FA']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Firstly I would like to thank you for the two weeks that I am going to stay in the Camp California
Secondly, I will be able to travel on July because I am a manager so I can not travel another time. Now I am going to answer a few questions: I think it is better for me to stay in a log cabin because I have terrible backaches so I can not sleep on the floor. I would like to sing and photograph, I've done a course about photography and I think that I am very good on it. In the other hand, I can not sing very well but I would like to do this there.
I would like to know which type of clothes I will wear there, would you check the weather forecast for me, please? And how much money I am going to need to have there with me?
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely.

Finaly the day to pay my credit card arrives and where was my money? I started to look in everywhere. I've asked my mom and my friends and everybody didn't know where it was. My mom said:
' You've told me that you were going to put it in your wallet.'
I started to look for my wallet and I couldn't find it,. Now I was without my money and my wallet. What could I do?
Suddenly the door bell rang. I went to see who was there. It was and old woman asking who was Maria.

Sometimes people go to the mall to look at products and don't even buy anything. But of course, there are some exceptions. For example, when you buy something, you might lose it and never again see it, or you could be robbed, or even if the product has something wrong with it, then you have to swap it and that takes time.
And sometimes the credit card machines don't work, or they don't accept your card or even if you have exceeded the limit of your credit card.

The first idea about shopping is that buying something will make a pleasure to the buyer and for that reason, will be enjoyable.
But this is not always the case: at first, you see a very pretty item which you'd like to try. When you ask to, the seller offen answers that your size is missing., you try to find the same thing in another shop. You ask the seller for your size. His answer is: ""Everything is here, Madam!"" As you understand that you won't get any help, you waste your time looking for the right size.
Finally, you find the right one but you don't have enough money. At the time you realise it, you also realise that the shop is closing in five minutes.
So, you run to the bank but have to wait for the queue. There is only one minute left! It's your turn and you as quick as possible. You run back to the shop and get your item.

Firstly, I was asked the time my trip would be and I have come to a conclusion that the only time I will be able to go is in July because during this very month I have my winter break both from work and school and that is when I will be free to go.
About accomodation in tents or log cabins, I would enjoy much more being in tents as I believe is the right type of accomodation for going camping?
Another point mentioned was the choice of activities. I would like to try sailing as I have never sailed before and also climbing as I enjoy hiking a lot. I actually have much resistance and balance so that will help me in both activities.
Now, I would like to request some information about clothes and money. What type of clothes and how much money should I take with me?

Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes, however do we really like the process of chosing them? At times, it is not only the matter of having to make a choice but the trouble of finding something, which can kill a lot of time and specially when your doesn't fit with the in fashion. The colour along with the style and size, blue or red, long or short, medium or large.
What is more, we can say that price is often very off-putting as well. Most people usually go shopping for something which is affordable, and many times they find, for example, a dress, they like a lot but they cannot buy it because it is terribly expensive. Then, I consider a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress.
Finally, of going in and out of fitting rooms and figuring out discounts. etc.
Is that enjoyable?","['RT', 'DN', 'R', 'S', 'MP', 'RP', 'MP', 'IV', 'RD', 'UP', 'RV', 'RY', 'MN', 'W', 'UP', 'MA', 'CE']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

I'm writting to answer your questions but, first of all, to thank you for the prize. I would like to travel in July because it is school holliday here in Portugal and I will have the entire month to travel, so I have no preference for the weeks.

Dear Madam
Thank you very much for your letter of 1/6/00 I was really amazed with the new that I'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
Respect to the date that I would like to travel must be only on July 15th because my classes will finish at the end of June and I'm going to be with free time to do so since this date until early August that I will start to work.
I would like to spend my time at your Camp site in log cabins. I think is going to be more confortable for me due that I'am very sensitive to changes of temperature and I can't take the risk to catch a cold as you know I'm going to start to work.
The activities that I would like to do there are the followings:- Singing (I'm very good singer); swimming (I'm not good at all at this one) but I enjoy to spend time in the water I really do.
Would you be so kind to let me know what kind of weather do you have on July in order to choose the right cloth to bring and also I would like to know approximately the amount of money that I should bring for the items that are not cover.
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Subject: The lessons should be filmed
Date: 13, June, 00
Instruction:
English class is going to make a short video about school daily life. The aim of this report is to give the suggestion of which lessons and activities should be filmed.
Lessons and Activities
Speaking and Listening class should be filmed because the purpose of this class is to encourage students talk about some topics they choose and discuss with others in order to prove their speaking and listening skills.
Topical class is similar to speaking and listening but the materials are more up-dated. The teacher use video, pictures to show students about festivals, sports, museums, ect. It is popular by the students.
Canteen is the place students stay together apart from class. Quite a lot of students spend their free time there for relaxing and talking.
Basketball is the most popular activity, whick takes place between 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm from Monday to Friday every week. Not only but also a lot of students watch.

There are a lot of interesting activities and it makes hard to choose only two. Given the circumstances I would like to learn more about Photograhy and Painting. I have same skills in drawing landscape but I have no idea about photography. Taking picture is a new experience for me.

How are you doing? I couldn't write you because I was very busy.
Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert in my town. I applied for a job at the ticket office because I hopped to see a lot of diffrent people. You know everybody has to cross this spot!
Given the circumstances they asked my for helping in the kitchen. You can imagine how disappointed I was. But it turned out as a funny and interesting job. I had to prepare the ingredians for every meal. It means I had to read the recipies very carefully. And I had to controll that nothing will be missed. The best thing was that I learnd a lot of new cooking ideas and I could observe new cooking tricks. On the other hand I had a lot to do and I was never bored. The people were all really funny and we were a good team. The time was quickly over and it was a great experience.

I remember when I was younger I used to go with my mom shopping to the stores but I did not like it, because I found boring to buy clothes spending a lot of hours in a commercial centre.
Another bad thing could be the enormous queues in the supermarkets, it is incredible how many time you can spend in there.

From the first time that went there I understood that I was going to have a great night.

I am not really keen on art that is why I prefer doing some sports like surfing and sailing. If I have to be honest, I would say I have never practised none of them. Yet, I would like to try them because my city is too far from the sea so I don't have many opportunities of doing them.

I'm really happy because I've finally received your letter. If I didn't told you the experience of the pop concert in detail in my last letter was because I didn't have time. Please don't be angry. I will tell you everything right now.
As few months ago I chated, by internet, to a nice guy from Buenos Aires, who happened to be one of the member of ""Los Pericos"". We started mailing each other and became good friends. They have to make a concert in my city so when they arrived here my friend phoned me and invited me where they were preparing the concert.
The problem was that one of the technics was from England and nobody there spoke nor a word in English so I was asked to be the interpreter. It was so great!! Not only because I learnt a lot about concerts and music, but also because I practised my English.

I received your letter the other day, I was very happy to find out that I won two weeks at Camp California. Well, to answer to your questions, I would prefer to attend at this camp during the month of July because it is the only time when I can get vacations. It is because I am an apprentice, so they let me have my vacations only in July!!
Well, for the accomodation at Camp California I would prefer staying in a tent. I think it is more fun sleeping in a tent than in a log cabin. It is more like adventure being in a tent, and you are closer to the nature, and the animals!
For the activities I think I will choose swimming because I love swimming and being in the water. And I am really good at it, I used to do some competitions when I was younger. And for the other I will chose tennis, I really enjoy this sport, I am not really a good player but I like to practice tennis during my free time! Since I'm coming during the month of July what kind of clothes should I take with me, and I have another question, it's about money. How much should I take? And is it better to have change or checks?
Best Regards,
Helen","['MC', 'TV', 'UT', 'UT', 'RV', 'FN', 'RA', 'W', 'RT', 'S', 'MD', 'UD', 'R', 'RP', 'RV', 'UQ', 'MN', 'TV', 'RP', 'RP', 'RV', 'DV', 'RT', 'RT', 'RP', 'RP', 'RN', 'RN', 'RP']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,6,0,3,3,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0

Well this is abosolutly true, espacially when you go shopping on Saturday. Everyone goes shopping on Saturday so the mall is always crowed, and most of the people are stressed, it's crazy. For exemple you go into a cloth shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that would fit their new skirt, so they are looking every where, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want. And then they have and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you choose. And you have to wait after to buy it, so finally you waited so long that you are getting late, so you get stressed to. So it's really not enjoyable to go shopping. Plus most of the time, you see all those mothers looking after their kids, and yelling their name's kids into the shopping mall because they lost them. So you are getting a headache because you hear the kids crying, the mothers yelling, if I can give you an advice: DON'T GO SHOPPING ON SATURDAY!! You get headaches, you get stressed, and finally you get bruses because of the woman that pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you!!!","['DY', 'S', 'SX', 'RP', 'S', 'MP', 'RN', 'TV', 'RV', 'RP', 'MA', 'TV', 'MA', 'TV', 'RV', 'TV', 'SX', 'MP', 'W', 'RT', 'TV', 'TV', 'RP', 'R', 'S', 'RA']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,3,0,1,2,0,3,0,2,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Thank you for the good programme which you have organised. There is only one thing we don't agree with you, it is the Tuesday 14 March.
We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. and we would all like to go to this show. It would be very special for us because we haven't seen something like that before. There are four different shows. First there is a show with latest fashions, after they show us the leisure and sports wear and then there are the make up and the hairstyles shows.
The show is not as expensive as the Science Museum because the entry of the show is free for students.
You see, the programme has only to be changed on Tuesday morning. In the afternoon we go shopping how you have organised in your programme. In our opinion; it is enough to go one time in a museum and it is on Wednesday.

Now, we are in the 21th century. Most of us live in houses or flats and it is most very comfortable. But in which kind of homes will people stay in the future? What will be different and what wont change? We can need our imagination for answering these questions but we will never know the right answer.
I have ideas: In the futur, maybe in 2113, there will are houses like now but only with more technical things. The life at home will be more easy because a refrigerator which fill up itself or a bathroom which clean itself. So, people wont have to clean their houses because there are machine for all works.
But I think that people will altough need a bed and a table with a chair. These things and a lot more went change or wont be forgotten. So, I think. houses only will be more moderne and more practique but not very different from our home in the present.
This is my idea and we will see!","['RP', 'DY', 'RD', 'RV', 'MP', 'RV', 'UT', 'FV', 'RJ', 'RP', 'S', 'FV', 'UY', 'UD', 'IJ', 'M', 'AGV', 'W', 'AGV', 'MP', 'TV', 'MD', 'MD', 'CN', 'SX', 'S', 'SX', 'MP', 'UP', 'W', 'S', 'DJ', 'FN']",0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,2,0,3,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,0,0

The reason of my letter, is that our class would like to suggest a few changes on our programme of London, because we have seen an advertisement about an interesting activity that we could include in our programme.
First of all, we want to say thanks to you because we know the effort you have done organising our good programme, but we would really like to go to the London fashion and leisure show we saw in the advertisement. We think that perhaps in Tuesday March 14, we could change the time of going to Science Museum, and (we) go earlier to the Museum, such as half past eight on the morning, so we could go after, at ten o'clock to the show, and we could also delay going shopping on that afternoon, because the show lasts til seven o'clock on the evening. And we have thought that we could go shopping the next day, because we do not have nothing to do on that afternoon.
Finally, we would like to say you to think about our suggestion, the show would be fantastic, we would know about the latest fashions, the Leisure and sports wear, and also learn about how to. It's a great opportunity to know more about fashion. Please, let us go to the show, for students are free.

Although computers will give us all the material things, it could not give us things like the feeling of being in your home,, etc. That things won't change in our home. We will live in our homes with our family, who will give us love..., that kind of things will never change.

Politicians, musicians or film starts are controlled all the time, since they wake up in the morning until they go to bed in the evening, by journalists and photographers who follow them and observe all that they do.
It is certain that these people have fame, fortune and success, and that many of them are rich, very rich. They usually appear on TV, go to shows, sports competitions... But I'm sure that all these things can not give them back one of the most needed things: a private life. And believe me, there is no money in the world to pay that.

The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a change to go.
I have a few suggestion on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in. We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon. We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping. We can however go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show.
Lastly, I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show. I hope you would consider this matter. I look forward to hearing from you.

No, in the future, the present will be the past and these things now new to use will be old, outdated and changed.
I see a very different home for us in the future. Most things will be computerised. We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys. We an on and off lights with touch pads and remote controllers. We might even be able to open the door without getting out from the living room. Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door.
Although all that may change our houses may be still the same. The rooms and size should remain as it was and the living rooms and all may still be decorated in the same style. We might still favour that old carpet and couch. The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the amount of rooms should not change too.
In the future, every child might have a laptop. And instead of going to school, why not let school come to you? We will be learning at home using computers and disc. Never to leave the house or wake up so early. Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilitles we are using. We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot, a machine, or something other with the same purpose.
Our homes will still be the same in terms of the kitchen, it will still be filled with vegetables and meat. This is because people won't miss the great taste of food although it could be subsituted to a vitamin pill or two.
Lastly, I think that all this changes won't really be noticed as we change it daily and slowly instead abruptedly. People will be able to adjust and change with the times.","['RP', 'MP', 'AGN', 'RJ', 'FN', 'RN', 'MN', 'IN', 'RP', 'RV', 'RP', 'RD', 'SX', 'R', 'RN', 'RV', 'UT', 'RV', 'FN', 'AGV', 'AGV', 'RA', 'RV', 'RN', 'RY', 'FN', 'TV', 'MA', 'S', 'TV', 'R', 'RN', 'RP', 'RV', 'MP', 'S', 'RT', 'AGD', 'RA', 'MT', 'S']",0,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,1,1,4,4,0,1,5,1,3,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Annette,
Thank you for your letter, like usual, it's a pleisure to receive a word from you.
I understood that you're looking for your cousin's birthday present, and you'd like give to him a book, which, I think, it's a good idea. The last book I read was Wuthering Heights by Emilie Brontë. It's a fantastique book, which I recommend to everybody keen on lovestories. It's a perfect combinaison between passion and life difficulties. I recone that it's quite not an easy reading, but as you described your cousin, I think she really will enjoy it, she's such good in litteracy, that it won't be a problem for her. I really think you should choose this one for her, it does go with her personnality. It'll be a good point for her general culture, Wuthering Heights it's a classic, which everybody knows about it, even if they didn't have read it, they, at liest, know the story.
Let me know what would be your choice.

On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show, that we saw advertised and we are interested indeed. In addition we would like to thank you about the programme.
Firstly, I would like to give you some details about this show. It will take place in Central Exhibition Hall, in London, on Tuesday 14th of March and will be 10.00 - 19.00
I would like to mention that this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going for shopping, so I believe it will be a good change for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students! The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is suitable as well with our programme because until 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping.
Secondly, I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly what does it include. The latest fashion will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear. Really interesting! Moreover. I think that it will be a great opportunity to all of us to be on this show while we are going to be in London. But, if there is a problem that the show is on Tuesday afternoon, the same hour with shopping, I suggest having the shopping on Wednesday afternoon that we will not have anything to do!

I believe, that if somebody wants the fame and the glory must be tottally sure about the results. For example, the politicians the have choosed their careers, they must know that and the most important is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful of their movements or else they are going to have bad reputation, and they will be not trustworthy.
. If somebody is a film star this mean that has got a different kind of life, more comfortable, more interesting but it doesn't mean that he or she can't be like normal people even if he or she is a star.
If somebody wants to be famous of cource must be and the mass media will be following him or her. But I think that the are limits. Everybody deserve to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer. It doesn't matter what kind of carreer or job you are follow. You must control your behaviour and try not so much yourself.

Who have never dreamed to be a famous singer, sportman, actor or a politician? The success of these people is so big that they are known all over the World.
I think that this kind of people have a poor life because they never can be because all the poeple know them and want to know a lot of things about them. They have always to be careful about what they say and what they do.
In my opinion I think that if famous people is always followed by journalists it is not the responsability of the media but of the huge quantity of people who are interested in famous people life. Firstly, because it is a lot of "" scandale magazine readers "". Secondly, because they have admiration for them and lastly because they want dreams and see what a "" star life"" look like.

I am a student from your class and I would like to thank you first of all. It's a good programme, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery.
A few students and me have heard about a fashion and leisure show. That show takes place on 14th March from 10.00 - 19.00. They show the latest fashion, leisure and sportswear ands something for the women: make up and hairstyle trends. That show is free for students, so it's also a big advantage. We have it already discussed and we think it would be a great opportunity because a lot of students a very keen ongoing.
I know that it is a change. But I have thought about it. On Monday we could first go to the Sience Museum and in the afternoon to Greenwich. Then we could go sightseeing by bus on Wednesday after lunchtime. I think there is no need to go shopping because we can do our shopping in Cambridge, as well.

Are you dreaming of being a Star? It must be wonderful when you have a lot of money and everybody seems to know you. Really?
I think the main problem is that you would lose your private life. That's the price you have to pay nowadays. But you need all the journalists to become famous so the only way is to accept that there are journalists and that they are just doing their job.
No one told you to be famous. If you are famous it was your choice and therefore is a price to pay. Of course you have fame and. But then everyone will recognise you when you are walking on the street.

It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. We had been trapped in the snowy, almost vertical slopes of the ""Tête Blanche"" for more than ten hours by then. We were there, alone, my friend with his broken leg and myself.
We had decided to climb that more than 3'700 -metre-high mountain near Arolla in Switzerland two weeks beforehand. We had been preparing the trip for several days when we started to climb the mountain, on that 4th of September 1995. It all went as expected and we reached the summit in six hours. However, it started to go wrong after one hour of downhill walking. My friend fell down and badly hit his leg against a rock. We could immediatly see that it was broken. He couldn't move any more and my mobilephone was not able to find a proper network. We were trapped!
I finally decided to carry him on my back on the way back to the rescue chalet. It was dangerous because of the steepness of the slope and we risked falling down all the time. However, we would have frozen to death if we had stood where we were. After ten more exhausting hours of walking we finally reached the chalet, from which we were able to call a helicopter.

The river trip to Greenwich is certainly something we are all looking forward to, but due to the London Fashion and Leisure show, my class asked me to propose a change in our schedule.
This show consists of a big fair in the Central Exhibition Hall in which we will have the opportunity of seeing the latest releases on sports wear, make up, hairstyles.

Dear Sarah,
I'm sorry it took me so long to write you back, but I have being very busy lately: Anyway, on your last letter you asked me whether. Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie would be or not a good present for your cousin. Well, having read the book before, I can say it would be a great idea!
You told me your cousin likes suspense books and stories, the ones you keep trying to figure it out who is the killer. Agatha Christie's stories just couldn't be more suitable for your cousin. Specially because there isn't just one story, but a whole lot of them. Personally speaking, I think they selected the best ones to be published.
Now, tell me more about you. Are you already on holidays. My school has finished, but I'll need to sit a big exam at the end of this month so that I can go into College. My parents and I will spend our holidays in Australia and I just couldn't be happier! I just can't wait to go abroad for the first time!

Some of them, however are not doing their job probably. They don't inform people about news, education or documentaries. They just published gossips about famous people, such as politicians, musicians and film stars.
I believe all the people famous or not, deserve to have private life without journalists to following them all the time. They are humans like all of us with their problems, their good and bad times and of course they don't want to be publish them in front of millions of people because a journalist thought that this is right.

And, there should be a electrical servant in everyone's home. So there's no need for people to do the household work. There should be no beds at home because some pills are invented to make sleepy. If you're tire, the pill can give you vitamin, protein and make you refresh
For electrical goods, there will be no any kind of electrical products except computer. People will do anything on the computer, including watching TV, listen to music, chat with people. As the computer is being as a multi-functional products.
on the other hand, there're some ways that remain the same. The toilet should remain the same as people need to use daily and nothing can replace it. Second, there should be friends and family members in the home to provide joyful and fun. Since friends and family members won't change and replace, by anything.

When I got close to the shop, I checked if anyone was around and luckily was not. Then I approached slowly the door, broke the lock and opened the door. However, my adventure was not over yet. There were laisers all over the place, with which I had to be careful with.
Suddenly something went wrong, the alarm was making noise. I ran towards the diamond grabed it got out quickly, ran out of the back door. By surprise I saw a car waiting for me outside. I got into the car gave the jewelry in exchange of my brother, took him and left the place.","['S', 'SA', 'DN', 'RP', 'S', 'RT', 'TV', 'MP', 'RJ', 'X', 'W', 'S', 'UT', 'RT', 'RP', 'MD', 'MP', 'IV', 'MP', 'MC', 'RN', 'MC', 'SA', 'RT']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,3,0,0,3,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0

Regarding the programme you have organised, it, but I would like to suggest to you something that the students saw in an advertisement.
It is good start to go on sightseeing by bus on Monday morning, we can se all famous buildings in a few hours. It's seems relaxing to go to Greenwich in the afternoon looking though the river.
The idea about going to science museum is fantastic, I read about the museum, it is really interesting in science history.
On Wednesday after viseted national Art Gallery, we can have a chat about ours next holiday at the free time in the afternoon.
The advertisement that students saw is about a fashion show, but to go to the show you will need cancel the tour on tuesday and add the show, because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Nowadays the main attroction in the newspapers and television is private life of famous people.
It is really interesting how people like knowing famous people life. Without someone famous know, photographs take pictures secretly, try to get money on it.
Sometimes being famous can get stress, everywhere they go there are people around them, especially journalists, trying to ask millions questions.
Famous people deserve to have freedom to do whatever they want, but it is quite difficult to do thing in a public places, because nobody like famous politicians or film stars without asking questions.

However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show It would be on the 13th of March from 10.00 to 19.00. It is a famous exhibition, where are showed.
We are all very interested in the show because England people have a different kind of life. It is also unusual to have such a great opportunity in our country.
Could it be possible to cancel the museum and the shopping and to replace them by the London Show? We may go earlier to the Museum or on the 15th March instead of the afternoon free time.

It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had always wanted to swim in the middle of sharks.
I lived in a small village on the ocean. My father was a captain on a huge boat. When I was a child, I used to go with him travelling from harbours to harbours. I grew up and I couldn't live whitout it.
Once I was fishing, when sharks came all around me. I got the strange feeling I could jump and follow them. Since this experience, I dreamt every night about that.
One Saturday I got on my motorboat and rode far away from the reef. My father was sitting next to me thinking that I was crazy. Some minutes later I was doing it, spending time with the fish, swimming round the sharks.

It is a pleasure to write to you and we want to thanks for organising a school trip to London. We have seen the programme list and we all think it will be enjoyable. the science museum because we all doing science in school.
Recently, some students have seen an advertisment about a fashion and leisure show in London. it will be on the 14th and we all want to go. So, it would be greatful if you can give us this opportunity to watch the show.
This is a great opportunity to learn something else because most of us have not been to this kind of show And it is free for students. it will be incredible if we have a chance to watch the show. So could you give us permission to go?
We also can suggest how the originally programme can be changed. We will have free time on Wednesday afternoon. So we can do shopping instead. Then, we can go to the show during that period

Nowadays, our home life allow us to have more free time to spend doing leisure activities like practising sports or going out. In the close future we will be able to do nothing because everything will be done by computers and machines, ( washing-up, hovering, ironing, gardening, cooking, etc. ) The question is, will it be better life?
On the one hand, we will be able to spend more time with our family and not to be worried about anything. No more housework, no more stress, nor more illnesses; everything will be perfect.
On the other hand, life will be boring, a large amount of workers will be have redundant and housewives will not have anything to do which will be extremely boring and tedious.

Dear Sir,
I am writing to you with a request for a change in the scedule of our trip to London. But, first of all, I would like to thank you for the time and the effort you have made to organize the entire programme. Everything seams very interesting and I am sure that we will all have a very good time.
Unfortunatly I have to suggest a change for the programme of Tuesday the 14th of March. That's because the ""Fashion and Leisure Show"" takes place that date in London. All of the students - including my self, think of this as a great opportunity that would be pitty to be missed, especially when students can enter for free.
According to the day's programme, we are visiting the Science Museum in the morning and we are going shopping in the afternoon. My suggestion is to use Wednesday's afternoon free time as an alternative solution of the shopping. This way we will be able to visit the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday evening, and see the show.
I hope that you will.

All students have seen an advertisement for that and they would like to go to the show. I think that will be very good programme. especially the part of the Latest Fashions, because is something which affect the people of all ages today.
But also the rest parts of the show seems to be very interesting. Leisure and Sports Wear is very interesting. I think that young people are affected from that in the way they dressed.
Make up and Hairstyles are also very important especially For our class, because the most students of our class are girls. The girls are interesting than boys, For make up and hairstyle. and they want to know all the latest news about these.

The whole class and I would like to thank you for the good programm, which you have organised for our trip to London.
The reason why I'm writting to you is the class and I have seen an advertisment for the London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 am - 19.00 p.m. It is a show about latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. We all are interested in fashions and hairstyles and it is a great oppurtunity for as because students have not to pay and we will know what we can buy on our shopping tour. I would like to suggest you how the programm could be changed. Instead of a shopping tour on Tuesday afternoon we could go to the show and do the shopping on Wedensday afternoon in our free time. What are you thinking about this suggesten?
I hope you will unterstand and class and I looking forward to hearing from you.

Dear Mr Robertson;
I am writing in reference to the programme for the English class, that is going to spend three days in London. I have already read the programme, and I agree with that, I think that the class will like going to Sightseeing by bus and in the afternoon going to River trip to Greenwich, Also, they can visit Science Museum, and they can going to the shopping, on Wednesday 15 March they going to visit The National Art Gallery, really, I think that is good programme.
However, I think as well,, is on Tuesday from 10.00 AM until 19.00 pm. They don't need to pay.
In addition, I think is a good a idea, because they could go after, when they have a free time, I am sure about that, they will like to visit that place. However, the programme could be changed just for a few hours, it is a great opportunity for everybody.
Finally, I hope that you understand my personal opinion about the programme, I will understand accept you personal opinion as well.
I look forward hearing from you.

My personal opinion about famous people, is good in one way and bad in another way.
I think that they live their life like hat, because they want to live this life.
They doing everything just for money, sometimes, they can make theirs life easier than they normally do. It is true, they deserve to have a private life without journalist following them all the time, however this news give them money, and confortable life.
Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, they live happy, because they know that the famous mean to be rich.
They can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, they must be a very good peaple, because "" the Famous "" is just for a few time, nothing is forever in this world.
My personal opinion is that, I think they aren't really happy, and they are selfish as well.
I do not really like will be a famous person, because you are not really yourselfh, and for me is the more important thing.

I'm writing to you on the name of all the students who will go to the London's trip.
First of all thank you very much for your programme, it's sounds very interesting and everybody is looking forward to it.
However, we do all have a request to ask you.
We saw an advertisement about the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"" in the Central Exhibition Hall in London.
This show is going on all day on March 14th.
As teenagers we're all very keen on fashion so it will be a great opportunity to go because in our, we'll never get a chance to see a show like that.
What we are suggesting you is to change the programme on the afternoon of March the 14th. Instead of going shopping, we could go to the show. Anyway, as students we don't have much money to spend on shopping and the good thing is that it won't affect your budget at all as the entrance fees are free for students.
We hope you consider our request which would be very appreciate in the class.

Because of us!
I know that everyone is excited about what happened to Michael Douglas' wedding or what kind of life the President of The United States is living but sometimes it's going a bit to far.
Those movie stars or politicians may have a lot of money, may do whatever they want but what is the price to pay? Would you like to live a life like that, every time you make a wrong step, the whole world is looking at you, judging you. It must be very exhausted to have the medias around you days and nights because you can't be yourself, you have to show your best side and character.
In my opinion it should be a rule which let the medias approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home to leave them at least one place to feel safe.","['W', 'MD', 'RJ', 'RT', 'RP', 'SX', 'RP', 'RJ', 'CN', 'ID', 'RA', 'AGV', 'CN']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

That is in the central Exhibition Hall, near the hotel, and it is only about fashion: latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make up and hairstyles. I think it could be very interesting and it is free for students ( what is really good).
It is a great opportunity because this show is only each two years and normaly it is difficult to. And, as you know we all are interested in fashion.

My sister was standing, crying and the front door. I took her in my arms and opened the door: my mother was sitting in a chair, reading a book, with blood all around her. I finally realized that she was dead.
The police arrived twenty minutes later, took my mother and checked to see what could be interesting to find the murder: lucky, the knife which he used to kill her was still here and in fact they could arrested him.
They found hime two months after and six months after he was in jail. To forget everything, I moved to Irkind with my sister in a small house in the countryside.

So, a day I decided to steal the bank. During weeks, I had prepared my programme, trying not to forget something important. Everything was ready and me too. So I knew that the day after would be the good one.
I get up very early. All the city was sleeping. The weather was cold. When I arrived in front of the bank, my heart was going faster. A few days before, I had founded a little window at the back of the building, so I entered by this way and by chance I just arrived in the monney. I hadn't never seen so much money.

That is one of the 3 days that we will spent in London as a. So we had this great idea if it is possible of course to include this exhibition in our programme.
The exhibition is caud the London Fashion and Leisure Show and it taking place at the Central Exhibition hall, in London From 10.00 till 19.00.
The class is very exiting about that because the Show conteins the latest Fashions, leisure and Sports Wear, make up and hair styles. We believe that is a great opportunity because is one of the best shows of the year, also a majority of the class never had the change to visit a show as this and the most important and best part is that the admission is Free for Students. And that we found it very good as otherwise we could not afford it.
So please if it is possible to make a small change to the programme and to move the activities of the Tuesday 14 of March to the 15 of March as to try to make a combination of the 2 days.

For example if you look back into the forties and compare the home with nowadays you can see that it has become more modern, especially the facilities in the kitchen and in the livingroom.
in the future it could be that you don't have to prepare your breakfast by your own, perhaps you just have to press a button when your alarm clock has gone. In addition to this you may have some roboters bringing the newspaper at the table, tidying up the house, doing the shopping and maybe they are also your living patners.
The place to spend the night will still be the bed. The livingroom won't get any big changes although the televisions, stereos and videos will become more modern and perhaps more difficult.

Since always I'd gotten the idea of travel abroad and experiece others people's life and cultures, so I decided to go to Paris as soon as I finished university.
I arrived in Paris for New Years Eve 2000 without a place to stay, not speaking any French, alone and with a little amount of money. But eventhough all of these desadventages above, I was folling my dreams and objectives and inspite of everything I was going to do it.
So suddenly, a week later I found me a job as an au pair, taking care of two little girls that only spoke french at that moment. It took me three months to overcame the languages and after this time the whole familly falled in love with me, that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and I feel like part of the familly, eventhough It was very hard at the beggining.","['R', 'FV', 'S', 'IQ', 'AGN', 'RT', 'MP', 'RJ', 'R', 'RP', 'S', 'UY', 'RV', 'S', 'RP', 'RA', 'RP', 'RN', 'RV', 'FV', 'FN', 'RT', 'S', 'TV', 'IV', 'MY', 'S', 'RP', 'RP', 'S']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,5,0,2,2,0,6,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

On the behalf of all the students, I thank you for organizing our trip to London and for the really interesting programme you propose to us as well. It is likely to enrich our vocabulary and our knowledge of the English culture... However, we would like to suggest you something:
A few days ago, we saw an advertisement about ""The London Fashion and Leisure Show"" which seems to be very attractive. Therefore, after having talked about it, we all concluded that we would be pleased to go there. Let me explain you what it is: It must be an exhibition which takes place in the ""Central Exhibition Hall"" on Tuesday and deals with the latest fashions, the different, make up and so on...
What do you think about our jobs? It would be all the more interesting for us as fashion is a great interest for people from our age. Moreover, you wouldn't have to worry about the price as it is free for the students. If you agree, we will only have to change the programme on Tuesday afternoon: I mean that instead of shopping, we would go to this exhibition. But I guess that neither us nor you would be against the sacrifice of a ""Shopping-Afternoon"" - that we can even put on Wednesday during the free-time - so that to enjoy the Fashion and Leisure Show...
Please, Let us know.

On the one hand, those people are equal to us in the way that they had a childhood, thy got married and built a family... The only difference between them and us is the kind of job they are doing which is literally a ""public job"". Therefore, why do we have to talk and gossip about them?! But on the other hand, the aim of a ""public job"" such as politician or actor is to be known and appreciated by the population. And here comes the: Do we have to someone's privacy to judge his work and appreciate him? Well, some people would agree whereas others would desagree. I guess this is an unanswerable question...
As far as I'm concerned, I would say that famous people made the choice to be followed and tracked by journalists all the time, when they chose to be famous. That's as simple as this! Everyone is aware of the celebrity's consequences so, if they really wanted their privacy, why did they choose a ""public job""?? Even if anyone deserve to have a private life,... However, I would add that journalists - being aware of that - should try to modorate what they write in order to respect altrui's privacy; since they would probably not be glad to have their own private life revealed!
But to solve this problem, we may think first about its origin... ""Reading the gossips "": isn't it what anyone of us love doing?? Therefore we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect altrui.
Why not?
To conclude, I would say that ""privacy"" and ""celebrity"" can't go together.

We lived in my aunt's house who was in the center of the village. In front of my aunt's house, there is a house with swimming pool, garage and garden. My aunt told me it was the famous French singer's house.
One night, I heard a strange sound. I loocked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine. They went into the house through a window. I though it was some rubbers.
I said to my friend that I wanted to go to see and he must phone to the police. I went near the house and waited to look what it would happen.
After ten minutes, one man came out with a big bag and went into his car. When the other man came out, I caught him and fighted him. The first man went away, because a police car arrived.

Nowadays, most people think that famous people have a so good life ( lots of money, comfortable house ) that they have to stop complaining about he media's treatment, because they have chosen to have this kind of life.
On one hand, it is true because famous people have to do their jobs, that means being interviewed, giving news to the audiance, and soon. Moreover, especially for film stars, lots of people are hoping to see them on the Tv or in the newspapers, and this is really good for their fame.
However, on the other hand, it must be so annoying to be followed by journalists or photographs all the time. You can't go outside quietly, and there is all the time a crownd of people who stands in front of your house waiting for you.
The question you have to ask yourself is: would you like to have all the time people around your house who are watching at you or people who are following you everywhere? I am sure that nobody would like this.

Famous people are special for the rest of the society. They form opinions and invent new fashion styles. Nowadays, the media is expanding its ways of communication so they need more information. The media is starting to get into the private life of these famous people.
It's important to respect other people lives because can cause serious problems in the family of the person or in his life. If the famous person doesn't mind in being filmed in his personal life there's no problem. But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacity the media has to respect. Everybody likes to be with your family without any reporter or photographer.

I am writing, on the name of all my English class, to thank you for the opportunity you give us to spend three days in London, but also to suggest some modifications in the programme.
The programme you has already organised is very interesting, especially because it provides a good combination between cultural visits and more relaxed activities.
But, in another hand, we have seen an advertisement for the ""London Fashion and Leisure Show"", which includes a range of different stands. The only day we can attend to this show is the Tuesday 14th March from 10 am to 7 pm in the Central Exhibition Hall.
We are really interested in visiting this show and the main advantage is that the entry is free for students.
In conclusion, I suggest that we go directly after the Science Museum to the show. We all agree that we have enough time in Wednesday for shopping.
I hope that you will agree with this suggestion. I am waiting for your answer.

Famous people have always been the center of interest for number of people. Their wedding, their holiday, their new haircut and so on. But do we think enough about the right to have a private life?
We can watch this problem from two different points of view. From one side, this people chose to become public people. If we don't want to be in the newspapers, we don't do politics or movies! But from the other, everybody has the right to have a secret garden, the right to be with his/her family without be disturbed by journalists and photographers. The case of the Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach such extremities.
In conclusion, I would say that both parts, famous people and journalists, have to respect some rules. As public people, stars and politicians have to accord some time to their public but fans and press people have to respect their private life and to stay polite and respectful.","['S', 'MP', 'SA', 'MD', 'FN', 'FN', 'FN', 'RV', 'ID', 'AGD', 'RN', 'RV', 'MD', 'MP', 'ID', 'FV', 'UD', 'UQ', 'RN', 'RN', 'RV']",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I wasn't sure of what to do, and the pressure of everyone watching me, was driving me mad.
Finally, I managed to move my right foot closer to the edge. I could listen the crowd shouting 'Go, Go '. That was my only chance.. Only few more seconds, otherwise my time would be over.
I didn't even think of boking down. I was already paralysed, and that wouldn't help me at all.

The clock was running.. tic, tac... And suddenly everything stopped. I felt an enourmous peace. Somehow I managed to jump out of the airplane and I was flying!

Thanks a lot for your letter. I am fine but quite busy because I have my German exams. Therefore I read Agatha Christie's,, Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie"". I can really recommend you this book, it is fabulous. It is also a suitable present for your cousin, I think. One story is about ten persons who stay together in a hotel on a lonely island. There is a storm and they can not leave. Suddenly a murderer happens! Believe me, you would never guess who the killer is! There is also Hercule Poirot, the famous detective and he finally solves the mistery. But I will not tell you more. You have to read it yourself. And if your cousin likes crime stories it is a perfect book!
Unfortunately it is quite expensive, £32. But do not worry about the price because your cousin will love it!

Indeed, we are especially interested in the sightseeing by bus. The river trip to Greenwich is also a marvellous idea! Moreover, we couldn't go there without visiting the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery.

How wonderful it could be to see the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear in this city, so famous for it! Besides, as there are more girls than boys in the class, they would certainly enjoy attending. Lastly, it is free for students, which is fantastic!
So, instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon, we might go to the Show. We may go shopping on Wednesday afternoon, as we should have had freetime. What do you think of this suggestion?

On the one hand, I think that some famous people are looking for the media attention. Indeed, it can be useful for their career. The more they are in the media, the more they will be famous. According to me, some of them need to be appreciated by fans, they need to be loved and see themselves on television. However, some others only use the media to come back, because they cannot find a job anymore. They need to be famous again. Besides, I consider that some stars sometimes call journalist to tell them where they will be, in order to have free advertisement. Moreover, according to me, it is also a good way for them to earn money. Famous people are so often asked to give interview that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it, either in the newspapers or on television.
On the other hand, for other famous people, being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame. In my opinion, it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they have to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photograph. They cannot go to public places, unless they make-up themselves and they are ready to sign autographs. They would really like a normal life, either because it is their temper, a regarding to their children. Nevertheless, they are never let alone, which is a shame. We have to respect them as human beings, what we often forget they are.","['UD', 'W', 'ID', 'RV', 'AGN', 'RN', 'ID', 'FN', 'W', 'R', 'RN', 'RV', 'UP', 'R', 'R', 'RV', 'RA']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0

I remember it as if it were yesterday. We were both 18, and we had the university access test already done. The problem was that both of us wanted to go to the same university, the NASA university in Houston (Texas). Of course we hadn't got enough points in the test to do it so.
So, that, we decide to access our school Main database and change our test results. This way we could obtain seldom places at NASA university.
The task was not easy, with 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algoritms and databases but anyway we decided to do it there was nothing to lose.
It took us two weeks to modify the results in a very complex operation in which we should take care of hiding all our fingerprints.
The operation was successful. Both of us went to the NASA university and nowadays we work for the CIA developing secure system and new encryptation algorithms.","['TV', 'MC', 'TV', 'M', 'TV', 'UD', 'UY', 'U', 'MP', 'RJ', 'RT', 'S', 'MP', 'IV', 'S', 'FN', 'DN']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

According to me, you can't deserve to have a private life when you're famous because when to start you career you know that medias will be hunting you everywhere and more famous you get worst it is going to be because that the life style people wants to know everything, for instance, about their favourite actor or about their president.. they saw them many time on T.V. or Cinema, So people wonder about them. And famous people like it because if you're a star or whatever it's because you like to show yourself.

It is also normally, that the journalists are after them. They want to get from them all the details of their life, especially from their private. Who got married, who got divorsed or who had a remarkeable changing of his complexion, these are questions, who most journalists are interested in.
But what life is it, when you even can't go to a restaurant being afraid of, the journalists, will be waiting outside for you? It is sometimes a real fight who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician. Famous people diserve to have a private life. It is a right like everybody from us has.

I am writing to express my pleasure about the programme that you have prepared for our school, especially the excellent idea to visit the National Art Gallery.
In addition, I would like to inform you about an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which my classmates and I have seen. We are really interested in latest fashions and new hairstyles, but also we are keen on knowing about leisure and sports clothes and especially girls enjoy seeing the different kinds of making up.
Furthermore, we have been informed that students are allowed to see this exhibition without paying money. This event takes place in Central Exhibition Hall in London, on Tuesday on 14th of March.
I would be grateful if you would consider my suggestion. If you agree to visit this exhibition, we will spend our day there, thus we should cancel the shopping, but we will be able to purchase some presents next day, as you have not organised a specific plan.
I look forward to your answer.

While I was listening to my favourite cassette, I heard a strange noise. Immediately I opened my door and... I could not believe my eyes! A short man stood in front of me!
Without any warning he pushed my arms. I shouted as I pained. I realised that he was very strong. But I was faster and more intelligent than him. I ran quickly and I managed to escape from him, I found one hidden wooden spoon and while he was passing in front of me I hit him.

As far as organisation is concerned, adequate number of double rooms with shower or bath have been booked for your group at the Palace hotel located across the main street from the train station. To come to our college, you can either watch downhill to the lake front (about 10 min ) or take the new cable car from the train station. The college is just stairs away from the bottom end.
The end-of-conference party will take place on a boat cruising on the lake. It will start by a speech from the Director of the conference, followed by a meal. The recreative part will begin at 10 pm with a short musical comedy performed by some of our students and end with fireworks launched from the roof of the college at 2 am. As nights may be cold at this time of the year, may I suggest that you take with you a pullover. Appart that, there is no recommendation as to what to wear.

The mobile phone.
Once heavy, expensive and not reliable, the new mobile phone fits in almost any pocket and is given away by the operator to attract new customers.
Due to the mobile phone. communication has changed, not improved.
Of course it allows to be reached everywhere (even in places you wouldn't want.) For rescue teams, it is a great help. But isn't it a handicap outside professional life. Shouldn't people communicate with those they are next to instead of calling someone 2 miles away. It is not rare to see two people walking side by side, both talking on the phone.

I am writing to reply your letter you wrote me on 10 June.
Firstly, I would like to tell you, that the group has been booked into Palace Hotel, which locates beside the congress house in the centre. You can make contact with Mrs Brackenbury 06 8793888. Secondly, the best way from the hotel to the conference is to take the bus, which is specially organized by us. The bus leaves at 8:00 every morning and gets back to the hotel at 6 o'clock in the evening. Off course there's also a bus number 8 in front of the hotel is also suitable, but it leaves only every half an hour.
The end-of-conference party, which happens in the evening on 20 June, is going to be held on the coast. Beside the barbecue, there are some well-known student bands from our country are performing music through the whole night. What's more is, that there's a Latin music band coming to make the party more colourful. It plays from 10:00 to 11:00,. The main events of the party will end up at about 12:30 in the night. As you see, what to wear is just something casual.
Finally, in the last afternoon, we could visit the museums, markets (we have a very interesting robot-market). Basically it's a free time for the students to look round by themselves.
I hope your questions re answered appropriatly.

When booking a airline, we can just simply make a phone to any agency, and get it done in one minute. Secondly, instead of tons of books to get the information what we need, we can very easily search it from internet or on the local network.

Moreover, with computer network, it can be possible that people work from home, projects, controling operations or conferences. Lastly has been also. Instead of the tranditional telecommunication, we can talk, mail or even see each other with the help of computer network.
Of course there're also some aspects in which the computer technology need to be improved. For example, reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as on papers. A very important and severe problem is the reliability and security. Till now, to completely rely on computer.

Our college is not much far away. You only have to take the subway-train. After three stations you have arrived Brooklyn street. When you come out of the subway you see our college.
The conference starts at 6 o'clock and ends at 8 o'clock. The students have prepared a music program for the end-of-conference party. There will also be an international buffet. So don't eat too much before you come. And please don't worry about clothes. There are not any rules.

I received your letter this morning and I would like to thank you for your interest in the Conference. I hope I can answer your questions.
At First, this international student conference has the intension of explain to students how important is the. In addition to this, we choose the luxuery Palace Hotel which is comfortable enough and in a good location. The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city, so you can go by train, by bus or by car. I suggest you should go by train and go out in the Museum Station. The Conference will happen in the Hotel, which is.
The Conference,, it is a quite well organized. It will starts at eight in the morning and will finish around five in the afternoon. I suggest you should wear something informal. Even though we want to make things as more comfortable as possible to our students.
I am very happy that you want to know my area, although I am afraid an afternoon is not enough. However, if you want, you can call me and I can show you some interesting places. I will be very glad. I look forward to hearing from you.

Cars, boats, motobikes, airplanes: Who did never use this once? This is a good question. The humans seems that they are running and the fastest of this inventions is certainly, the airplane.
At First, when Santos Dummont invented the airplane, he probably didn't think how the people could transform his creation. In this world, where the nations fight to be the better: the airplane became the most important thing in the war. Unfortunately, it was used to kill a lot of people.
However, the invention of the airplane has brought us some. How could a person come from Brazil to Australia? Maybe by boat, but it could take too long! The best way is definetely, by air. After this invention travel around the world is so much easier. Now, we have to say thanks and congratulate all the creators who invented for us.
So, the airplane is definitely an important invention, because it have changed people's life in wars. Until now, it is being important in the transport of thousands and thousands of people around the world. Let's congratulate Santos Dummont!","['R', 'S', 'TV', 'AGA', 'UD', 'RN', 'W', 'AGV', 'U', 'FV', 'AGD', 'UP', 'UD', 'FJ', 'R', 'RP', 'RN', 'RV', 'M', 'S', 'UP', 'RT', 'RN', 'R', 'AGV', 'FN', 'UT', 'TV']",0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

. In the past the people didn't have electicity and if they wanted for example to read or to cook something they used to do in the fire. It's important to have electricity because without this you can't do anything.
The other one is the television. You must have TV because you can liten what it happend in the world and you can watch some places that you didn't go. You can enjoy you time to watch a film if you have free time.
The boat it's not so important but you can use it for fishing and to see some places.
The car now is very important in our life you can go wherever you want. In this year.

You can't lose the chance to see this castle because it is an excellent view and always there are a lot of people there and there are little shops where you can buy souvenirs.

You have been booked to stay in the Palace Hotel which is a very pleasant hotel not far away from here. The best way to get here is; once you have gone out of the hotel, turn right, then follow the signs to the hospital, because it is just by our college. When you are in the college ask for me.
The conference will take one hour, and, at 8 o'clock the party will start, it is a formal party and you should wear formal stuff. The dress code is: no jeans. We will prove you with food and drinks.
For your free hours I have quite a few ideas. There are lots of things to do here. We have a museum which is just at two minutes from your hotel. You can also go to a nearby park and eat something in the café. If you go to the main street you will find a street full of shops and I am sure the students would like that.

First of all, the hotel booked for the group is the Palace Hotel, which is very impressive in terms of comfort and facilities. This is a very central hotel located not far away from the conference hall. You will be able to get there either by bus (no 150) or on foot.
Next you are welcome to attend the party organized at the end of the conference. It will begin at elevenish p.m. and may last the whole night. People are going to be disguised there and it would be a good idea to wear extravagant multi-coloured clothes.
Finally I think that you should jump at opportunity to go to the historical Pergam's Museum before leaving. Some of the most amazing masterpieces are exposed there.

Subject: Bournemouth National Museum
As requested I visited the Bournemouth National Museum, which is, to my mind, one of the most interesting buildings of the area. Below is a summary of the most important relevant points and some recommendations you may need.
1. Architecture
The architecture of the building in itself is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation choice. Even if the architectural style may seem a bit ' heavy, this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparison all over the world.
2. Exposition
Although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day, it is such a rewarding and enriching time that people get never tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each section of the museum.
3. Restaurant
The adjoining restaurant is very enjoyable as well. The waiters are friendly and always ready to give advice. In fact it is just what visitors need after their trip through the museum.
To sum up, I would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums, because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also a very uncommon architecture and a quiet restaurant to have a rest if you need to.","['UJ', 'UN', 'UP', 'RJ', 'R', 'RN', 'W', 'RT', 'RJ', 'UD', 'RJ', 'M']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

About the end-of-conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night, and a special guest I still don't know will be expected. I suggest to wear casual clothes, I think there's no need of school uniforms.
To answer your last question, I would propose you to attend the local zoo, because many baby animals were born in the past few days.
Dear Mrs Smith, I hope the given information is useful for you. I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference.

Could you imagine there's no telephone ringing in an office? Or to live your live without chatting for hours with your best friend? Could you? I can't!
The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in the end of the 19th century. It was an invention nobody thought would be in future. Nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone, and calling to relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing. People need the telephone not only for chatting, but also for exchanging information in a very short and direct way with the possibility to answer immediately.
When I was a child, we had no telephone at home, and I always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village. Now I have my own flat, and the first I've bought was the telephone. I'll never take it away from my home.","['U', 'RD', 'FV', 'DN', 'TV', 'RT', 'AS', 'RV', 'MD', 'UT', 'RJ', 'R', 'RN', 'TV', 'RV']",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I want to inform you that I had already talked to Richard Brown and he informed me about the conference. Next week I will be start organising some events for this conference.
The event will organize at the Palace Hotel. The same hotel that will you. Palace Hotel is opposite the park, which is near the college. We chose that hotel because is it near the college and we don't need to use a transport. Because you know where is the college and you need to bring with me some things at the college to hotel I think that is better to come all the group in college and then we can go all together to the ` Palace Hotel '. The conference start at 9:00 o'clock you need to be at the college half an hour before.
Concerning the end-of-conference I'm thinking about some dance and singing events. Tell me your idea. About the clothes that we need to wear, must be uniform, because is the best conference to London and every year are coming from other colleges.
Finally on the last day we have organised a seeing-crossing around London. You will have the opportunity visiting some museums and zoo parks. I think it is a nice idea.

I have been asked for information on an interesting building to visit. I went to Hampton Court last year, and I think it is a great place to visit.
Location:
Hampton Court palace is localizated in Hampton Court. In addition to that, I think this town is wonderful and it has a magical beauty.
transport:
to get to Hampton Court palace, you need to take a train from Waterloo train station. From there depart the trains to Hampton Court. Moreover, I think by train is the best way to get there, because Hampton Court train station is very close to Hampton Court palace.
Price:
there is a price for children, students, adults and families. They are between three and six pounds each.

Hampton Court Palace is a building with lots of history and interesting things to see.

The Albert Hall College, the building where will be taken part is sited near Green Park Avenue; so get it from the Palace Hotel you can take the bus number 26, otherwise, you can take the Picadilly Line from South Kensigton Station to green Park station.

The aim of this report is giving some suggestions to a group of American students who has just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit.
Rome is a big city where they can find several moments and important buildings, for this reason I would suggest them to visit
1) ""Fontana di Trevi"" sited in Trevis Square in the center of Rome. That's a small square where there is a fountain very big. It was built by Canovas architect in 1638. That is the fountain which ""Dolce Vita"" film was taken place.
2) For other hand, there is Villa Borghese Building, That is a museum where they can find the most important sculptures and pictures of Antonio Canovas and, Bernini, who stayed for a long time working in Rome.
CONCLUSION
I would recommend them the buildings because:

Take the bus in direction center town. After four stops get off the bus. The name of this bus stop is 'Kongresshaus'. If you leave the bus, the conference is in the house opposite the road. You can't miss it.
Afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go in a disco. For the disco you musn't wear blue jeans.

The portable phone is an important invention, because nearly everybody has one, and so one can always call somebody if there is a problem.
Moreover, some portable phones have a connection to the web, so it is easy to read newspapers if one hasn't enough money to buy it.

The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities throughout those last years. The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our ordinary life is, of course, the mobile phone.
It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has becomed a necessary in some professional activities.. However, the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes, when in the hands of a high-school student.
It becomes then a real obsession for the average students, as e uses it before the lessons, during the lessons, during lunch and, especially, during examinations... Nevertheless, it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam, since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss. Bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate not the student's phone, but his parents'!","['RN', 'RN', 'RT', 'RD', 'MQ', 'RJ', 'S', 'RN', 'R', 'RJ', 'UP', 'W', 'FN', 'S', 'UD', 'FD', 'R', 'MD']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,2,3,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

To go to the conference from your hotel is really easy. You have to take the bus number 1 and get off at ""Black House"", which is the third stop.
After the conference, at about 8 pm. a party is organised. During it, everybody will have the opportunity to met and talk to the speakers of the conference. Food and beverages will be available. After the cocktail, the Band ""Zero one"" is playing their famous songs.
The clothes, required for the party are suits for men and cocktail dresses for women.
Before your departure, you will have time to visit the Olympic Museum or to make a sightseeing tour in our city.
I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference.

In order to write this report, I spent hours in this wonderful museum. There, I saw the exibitions and admired the building itself. I walked around the garden too.
Location
The museum is located in Ouchy, in front of the ""Delamuraz Hotel"". It is close to the main road, and at 300 meters of the station.
Outside
The building is made of white stones. It has two floors. Before going inside, you have to pas through the huge garden. There, ponds, pools, trees, flowers and ducks can be admired. I recommend you to take your swim suit, because in summer, it is allowed to swim in pools.
Inside
When you are inside the museum, you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls. There were all painting during the war by nurses. If you go down a few steps, you will discover the ceilar. Everything in this room is about wine.
To learn the whole history of the building, there is a room dedicated to it on the first floor.
I particularly recommend you to visit the ""blue"" room. Everything in this room is blue, the carpet, the ceiling and even the door.
According to the owner, it was a room where in the past people used to go when they were depressed.
Conclusion
To sum up, I would like to add that this house is the most famous in our city. You should come and visit it for the paintings or for the building itself.
You won't be disappointed.
The only negative point is that you have to pay 10 francs to visit. the house and the garden.","['S', 'RT', 'UT', 'SA', 'RT', 'SX', 'RP', 'MD', 'AGA', 'TV', 'S', 'RT', 'UP']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

As you know, the conference will be followed by a party. It will begin at 7 p.m and last until late in the evening. You don't need to worry about what you should wear to this event. In fact, the purpose of the end-of-conference party is to relax after a busy day, therefore you and your students can put jeans and sport shoes on.

First of all, your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, Main-Road, which is situated not far from our college. I'd suggest you to walk, it will only take you about seven minutes. Just follow Main-Road until to reach a junction, where you turn right and then walk along Denl-a-Lion Road. The college is a huge, yellow building - you can't miss it.
Secondly, you have required information about the end-of-conference party. It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m. and last until midnight. All the students will be provided with sacks and we have managed to book a band as well. The location of the party isn't fixed yet, but we will let you know after your arrival.
There is no need putting on special clothes for the party, casual ones should do it as well, for we want everyone to feel comfortable.
Last but not least I will give you some ideas of where to spend your free afternoon. I'd suggest you to visit our local museum, as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment. Provided the weather is fine, you could also go swimming or make a tour through our beautiful town. (I could book a guide for you if you're interested )
Please write back or call me if there is any more information you need.
I'm looking forward to meeting you and wish you all the best.
Yours sincerely,","['W', 'UP', 'FV', 'RP', 'UP', 'MA', 'TV', 'RV', 'FV', 'RP', 'R', 'R', 'L', 'RT', 'FV', 'RT', 'MP']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Who of you could imagine life without the telephone? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you can't attend her garden party because of an illness, without having to look her in the eye? When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea of how popular it would be one day. Its first appliance was to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person. Nowadays, however, the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it.
Take me, for example, I use it whenever there is a problem and I need some advice, or when I have to call off a meeting for any reason. I cannot always walk to the person and say ""Sorry, I must cancel our meeting"", because then it's too late anyway, isn't it?
Life definitely wouldn't be the same without the invention of the telephone. We use it daily in order to get information or to pass it on.
Just try to spend one week without using a telephone at all, and you will see that it is impossible to do so. So don't take the telephone for granted, but keep in mind that our modern way of life is mainly due to its invention.","['RY', 'UT', 'RN', 'R', 'TV']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Nowadays of the world industry is related to the automotive business: car manufacturing, gasoline extracting and refining, tyres recycling, and so on.
The industrial countries have encountered deep evolution of their strictures since the car has been made available to everyone.
At the beginning of the last Century only a few very rich people could afford a car; it was kind of leisure or sport to drive one. Today almost everyone owns a car and needs it for daily activities. The transport network has changed according to this social evolution.
The increasing number of are now creeting problems.
A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded, and enviromment issues are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries.
People and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the enviromment without impacting their mobility.

Welcome to London. You asked me for an interesting building to visit., I'll recommend British Museum. One of the reasons is you can learn almost everything about British history there.
The museum looks very old as some other buildings in London, but it is very modern inside. After going through the enormous main door, you can see a huge white round building which is a library. A lot of famous people have been to this library before!
The British Hall is on the first floor, not far from the library. It shows a large number of valuable things. Almost each one tells you a story or gives you a picture about British history. I'm sure all the students will gain a wonderful!
Apart from the national history, there are more about the past of the world. You can go to many sections such as Asia Hall, Egypt Hall, Europe Hall and so on. Countless fascinating things will definely take you the whole day to appreciate. After a visit to British Museum, you will be certainly able to put your history textbook away!

But I couldn't bake without an oven. I'm so grateful for this invention which allows me to live my passion.

Besides that he or she should look carefully into what he or she buys. I'm positive that after such an experience everyone says that the oven is a really important invention for our lifes.

"" Televisions is just an amazing invention."" My good friend said that. I agree with her. Firstly, televisions make us know more about the world without travel. If there are no televisions, we won't know what are like, or even what language they speak unless we go to that country.
Secondly, for some points, it can educate young children. Many TV programmes are especially made for children, such as ""Learn follow me "" and ""Be good to others "". Actually, they are quite good programmes and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child.
The last but not least, it is a good kind of entertainments. Maybe you will think that playing basketball, going to cinemas and discos are much better that staying at home sitting in front of an object. However, televisions can bring you the fun that other activities can't. If sometimes I don't want to go out and I don't want to be lonely, that's easy, just turn on the television and enjoy myself.

WHY THE OLYMPIC MUSEUM.
The Olympique Museum is situated near the lake and offer, for the tourist, an unbelievable view on the mountains and the lake. But also, the museum have a lot of gardens with several statues. Besides, the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern. First of all, the main interest of the museum is the olympic history. You can find a lot of documentary about it and you have several. In addition, you can play with several interactive game and learn about the rules of the olympic games.
REASONS OF RECOMMENDATION.
The principal reason is the cheapest price. You pay only for the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want. On the other hand, if you are more than 10 people, you can have a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person. It seems that this solution might be the best way to visit this museum.

Those days, the castle is being, so there is a lot of construction engines around it. That's not a big problem because there is a complete museum in it where you can see old pictures of the castle during the centuries. There is a lot of old items that were in the King's family.
You should have probably heard about the mummy who sleeps there for about two thousand years... You can see it in the dungeon. So you can visit everywhere you want with or without a guide. I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice holliday in Yverdon.

Thank you for your letter. I will try my best to answer the questions.
First of all, we have already booked the Five-Stars Hotel for your group. It is a modern hotel, near our college, and it is also very convenent to come from the airport. You can take both by buses or taxies. The nember 101 bus starts from the airport, than you can get off from ""city college"" stop. It would be a great chance to tark. This is just a relaxing party, just for the members have a chance to relax and make friends. So I think you'd better to wear a dress.
Finally, about the free three hours, my personal prefer to go shopping. Our city has got the biggest shoping centre in South England, there gathers so many shops. It worthes tp time and money on that.
I look forward to seeing you!

First of al, in my opinion, TV has a great education functions, and also makes the world become small. You can just sit at home then you can know what is happening all over the world at the moment. I would rather watching the news on TV in stead of reading in newspaper or hearing on radio because the news on TV are.
Moreover, the TV is a great company for the people who live alone or feel alone. I would like to open TV when I stay at home. Someone are talking, laughting, crying, you will feel much better than just yourself. Some TV programs are enjouable!
However, TV also has some disadvantages. You might just sitting in front of TV for hours learn nothing, or no more talk with your family. I think this is the badest influence in the society.
In clucsion, the TV has both advantages and disagvangtages, but on the whole advantages is greater than disadvantages.

Thank you for your letter which arrived me this morning.
Of course it is a pity that Mr. Brown has been ill, but we are happy that you are comeing now. You asked me which hotel the group had been booked. It is the Palace hotel, about a mile away where the conference will take place.
The best way to get there, is to take the bus number 7. The bus stop is opposite the entrance of the hotel. You will leave the bus at,, Royal gardens "". Turn left and go straight to,, Baker street "" At the need of this street there is the house number 18. This is our college.
You wish to know all about,, the end-of-conference party. As far as I can see there will be only a little dinner and a group of young singers will us by their songs.
Moreover you asked what to wear. Do not bother. I would recommend you wearing some casual clothes, like a jeans, a blouse or a skirt and a jacket. Donnot forget to wear a pair of comfortable shoes, because you will not have chance to change it.
Finally I give you some advise for what you could do for about three hours.
Firstly we have a nice and interesting museum, it is located near the hotel.
Furthemore there is the zoo with a lot of different animals, located to walk within five minutes.
Lastly there is also a very old and famous church, with many coloured windows.
For further information please call me up. I hope you will have an interesting conference here.

In my early childhood my mother said to me that when she has been a litte girl there has been only one telephone in the house where she had lived. It has been in her parents' appartement. The neighbours had come into to make their calls and to get their calls.
Todays nobody could imagine such a situation.
In every household there is a telephone at least.
There are a lot of advantages for it.
Firstly people are able to talk to person on every time. Be it: just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant thins. Moreover we always can call for help to the police, to the hospital or to a doctor. This could save life!
An other advantage is that all offices, firms and industries could not further exist without it.
Of course there is also a big disadvantage.
All people know this situation; people want not to be interrupted, maybe they are reading a book, having a good talk or are having a little sleep... then the telephone rings...! It is not an easy desicion how to react now. Being sincere, most of us would go to the telephone.
Another point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are ringing. everywhere and on every time. Especially youngsters misuse this kind of invention.
To sum up this invention is one of the most useful things. It is always the same how to people use it or not and how people handle it.","['MP', 'MP', 'TV', 'S', 'TV', 'RN', 'TV', 'TV', 'S', 'TV', 'UT', 'IA', 'DQ', 'RT', 'MP', 'MD', 'RT', 'RQ', 'RP', 'UP', 'UY', 'SX', 'W', 'AS', 'MD', 'RP', 'UY', 'RP', 'S', 'UD', 'UP', 'UT', 'RY', 'MP', 'M', 'UT']",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,1,2,0,1,3,0,1,5,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,3,0,2,1,0,0

The only appropriate to solve people's problems is the family. Teenagers usually think about a matter which is drugs. Their family could explain them how they avoid things. They know the way to do this. And the way is love.
Apart from this, parents could be very helpful to their children with difficulties of school. They help their children with lessons and give them some useful advice with their relationships. Because sometimes they are upset when they lose a friend.
On the other hand, friends are not suitable to do this. Definately don't give real solutions and advice. There is a chance not to be so good friends and imitate that they are.
The way which family comes in contact with the members so easily is love.

I am writing with reference to your advertisement which I read in a local newspaper two days ago. As I took part in this activities weekend, which was organised by the college, I would like to express my dissatisfaction to your article.
First of all, your advertisement mentions that the course had to be cancelled, because the teacher was ill, but the course cancelled only the last afternoon. Secondly, you mention that no body registered for the local history course. So I would like to inform you that 32 attended to this course. Thirdly, as far as the painting and photography courses is true what you say, they were very popular. I think that the reason for being these courses so popular is that people are very interested in these kind of activities. Apart from this the teachers was very experienced and the equipment was particullarly.
Furthemore, your article mentions that the weekend cost over £100. That is not true. The cost was only £60 including lunch. Last but not least, the college is planning to run another activities weekend next term, so it will be sooner than you mention.

I am very happy because I haven't received any letter from you, for long time, and as I had a problem with my mother's health, not serious, I didn't write to you. I hope you are fine.
First of all, you musn't panic. It's not serious enough problem to get upset. You must be very happy because you have been offed two jobs. In my opinion as you're really very keen on history, I think that the ideal job for you is to work in a museum. Now I don't know if it is tiring but I suppose it will be less tiring than a place in a restaurant.
If I were in your shoes, I would choose the position to the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same, I think that this choice is the best for you. But you should wonder which working place is more convenient to you. You'd better not to travel far away from your home. Also working in a museum include big tips from the tourists. Apart from these, despite the fact that it is a summer job you could be employed for the whole next year, if you are lucky.
Last but not last, I hope you will find my opinion helpful I wish your problem will be solved, but I don't think that it's about a problem. Whatever choice you will make I'm sure it will be the best for you. Drop me a line.

Dear Sir or Mam,
Last weak, I went to London to see the musical ""Over the Rainbow"". I was realy happy to see the ""Best Musical Show"" in London. But what I saw was exactly the opposite I expected. In other words, it was a disaster.
Maybe you could explain to me, what the problems were. By problems I mean, that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why were no discounts avaivable? But these are only little problems. The most disappointing thing was that there were diffrent actors which were not very good in acting. And after the show we didn't know what to do with the rest of the evening, because we actually wanted to go to the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was closed.
It wasn't realy a perfect evening like you promised on your flyer. I was very disapointed and I would like to have my money back. Some people might be silly enough to pay for such a bad show. I will tell everyone I know how bad it was.

Unfortunately, modern technology made the life for many people easier. If you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and noone had an opertunity to fly to another country for holiday, people had to walk or go by horse and ship. Today, everyone has the opertunity to just get into a car and drive to where ever they want to. Modern technology also allows you to go into the Internet to get any information you need. Every production is much faster and cheaper than before, because you don't have to pay for worker anymore. Every thing is controlled and produced by machines. This also is a very big disatvantage because many people are losing thier jobs. The only and simple advantage of modern technology is just taking the work from us so we don't have to do anything anymore. Another disadvantage is that every one becomes a bit more lonely because they wath TV or play or work with the Computer and don't see each other any more because they don't have to.

This is not a simple question because I got used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I'm going to try to explain you how.
I didn't have a computer until I was eight. Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability. In that time I used the computer only to play with its video games.
When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer. It became scencial to do my homework. And years later it enabled me to get a very good job.
One day my mother got a terrible disease. She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared. But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he answered us that the operation was a very simple one.
I think that if my mother had got ill ten years before, she wouldn't survive. The modern technology is better now than what it used to be.

The reason I'm writting this letter for you is that in my staying in London I felt very disappointed about your theatre.
When I went to that theatre I was very excited because I was thinking I would see my favourite musical star, someone actually didn't appear, I noticed there in the show, someone completely different of him so I felt bad.
Moreover, this complaining is not only about the actor, who ever, the problem is that the show started too late. I arrived there at 19:00 and the show began only 20:15.
I bought my tickets, I noticed I didn't have any discounts as it was written on the folder. After the show I wanted some thing on the theatre's restaurant, but it was closed.
After all the inconvenients that made me feel really mad. I think I can forgive your theatre, only if you give me a refund of the money I spent there, and some other more for all the problems I had.

I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement on the newspaper.
I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had, I was on holiday in London and I did not have time enough to spend there, but when you said that show was the best I decided to go. When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said it was not available. At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best it would cost what they said.
I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical show started later than I expected so I was getting nervous because I dislike very much the impuntuality, but that was not all.
When the show started the person who was acting it was not Danny Brook and he seemed not to be an actor. Really he was bad. Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed. So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had.
I am letting down because of your behaviour. You wanted to cheat me, so I will be very pleasure if you could give my money back.
I am looking forward your answer.

First of all technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too.
Since the creation of PCs, people - and me too, of course - are making different things.
For example we can buy food, clothes and whatever we need by internet or by telephone.
I can know what is happening in differents parts of the world in a few minutes.
A very good point of this change is that women have more freedom to have a job because before reaching the technology they have to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave oven.
In my case I dislike computers. I don't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help us to make our lives easier.
On the other hand what will happen with us in the future? Our life will be managed by robots and they will replace us in our jobs.
So, what are we going to do?

I recently spent a week in London and during my stay I went to the theatre in order to see ""Over the Rainbow"", - the musical show -. At first, I thought I would have a wonderful night out since I had read the advertisement of the show, nevertheless it has wrong information.
First of all, the advertisement of the show said that Danny Brook was going to be on stage. However, he did not appear during the show; that disappointed me a lot.
Appart from that, the show was delayed forty five minutes, consequently, everybody there lost control and became angry.
Another thing I would like you to know is that there were no special rates on the price of the ticket, which cost me £20. Besides, the theatre restaurant had closed down before I went out of the show.
Finally I would like to inform you that I had never spent such an umpleasant evening in my whole life. Therefore, I would be very grateful if you - the manager of the theatre - could send me the money back, at least the money I spent on the ticket.

Mr. Manager of the Circle Theatre,
While I was staying in London, I went to see one of your musical shows, ""Over The Rainbow"", because I had read the add on the newspaper, and I thought it would be an interesting experience. Let me tell you now how everything really was.
One of the reason I went to see that particular show, was the starring actor announced in the add, Danny Brook, but when the show actually started, with forty five minutes delay, I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play. The add also mentioned discounts, but that wasn't true either. After the play, which turned out to be just as bad as I thought, I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant, but it was closed, and for no reason!

Modern technology has brought many discoveries which have made our daily lives much easier. For example, internet has given us the possibility of acessing reliable information very fast.
I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances. That is exactly what happens to me. When I was younger I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project I would take a lot of time researching on libraries, looking for old books. Today I can connect to the Internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine.
But technology is not just about studying, it is entertainment too! I can watch pay-per-view films without having to go out to rent one. I can also listen to cds, play the latest games, watching concerts.. everything in a zap. You also have fast food, or food made in the microwave within a few minutes.

I was present at your musical show: ""Over the rainbow"". It was very excited thinking about being at the theatre, and I though with certainty I was going to enjoy my evening.

You can believe I was very disappointed when I saw that he actually was not playing and I was more bewildered that noone made an apologie for it! How rude!

Really, what a mess in the administration. Although, I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket, as you mentionned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, these couldn't possibly be reached either!

Firstly, I would like to say that I am very disappointed and upset with the show I saw. To begin my complains I can start with the actor - was a different one, not Danny Brook. Tina Truelove performed marvellous, but him I think he is a ""street actor"" from Covent Garden. Even worse it was the delay, the Show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, that drove me mad.

Also there was another problem, I planned to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show, I could not, was closed because it has been refurbished and redecorated.
Anyway, I expected to have a perfect evening out however I had just a terrible time, everything went wrong. The only thing to do is: to compensate me, send my money back, I am sending my ticket for that: Hope you'll be fair with me otherwise I am going to take this further.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Yours faithfully

Twenty first century - technology, technology, and technology. Modern life it has been full of science and tecnologies.
I am very pleased that I born under such good tecnologies like my parents didn't have the same luck. My life is much easier with all these stuffs above mentioned - tecnology and science.
Computers have changed people's life, many of them can work from home, they don't need to go to their offices. Internet is very handy, you can buy, send e-mail messages, or even have sex, that is really funny.
There is ambiguity about technology - can bring good things and terrible things as well. One good side is making life easier - computer, mobile phones, vending machines, etc.... The bad side is to use tecnology for war - missiles, weapons, etc....
Indeed tecnology has changed our lives, we have become more scepitical and cold. I believe that people should take.

I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"", wich you are the manager. I would like to say that there were many problems with the musical show.
The first problem concerned the main actor of the show. Although it was written in the show's addvertisement that the main actor was Danny Brook, it, unfortunately, was not him.
The show was supposed to have started at 19:30, but it only started at 20:15, so the public, including me, was forced to wait for fourty five minutes.
It was also written in the show's addvertisement that there would be discounts available for the tickets. However, there was not any.
The fourth problem concerned the Theatre Restaurant. Even though the addvertisement said we should visit it after the show, it was closed and no explanations were given.
In conclusion, the addvertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so I would like to ask for my money back.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I all happened a year ago, when Pat and I were still best friends and used to tell each other everything.
One day, I inocently told Pat that I was dating Philip Smythe, the school's hunk and most popular boy. I asked Pat not to tell anyone, and she promised me she wouldn't. I believed in her and trusted her blindly.
I went home that day after having told Pat my deepest secret with a weird feeling in my heart. Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a love.
The next day, I went to school and found out that Pat had told everybody that I was dating Philip. Suddenly, an enourmous saddness caught me, because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone, so he would definately brake up with me, and I knew I was going to stop talking to Pat, because she had just ruined my happiness and I couldn't trust her anymore.

Dear Sir,
Last week, I was on holiday in London, and reading the advertisement for your musical show, I had planned ( like it is said) ""a perfect evening out"".
But it turned out, it really wasn't a pleasant evening, and I didn't enjoy myself. On top of this, the advertisement wasn't correct at all, or I must have been to the wrong show!
According to the advertisement, the show should have started at 19.30, but it didn't begin before 20.15. That's nearly an hour later! The tickets were rather expensive, and the discounts mentionned in the advertisement weren't at all available at the theatre. They had never heard of such a thing!
The actors were not the ones expected: there was no sign of Danny Brook, and the person who played his part was very disappointing.
I was a little hungry after the show,, I had to find another restaurant since the theatre restaurant was closed with no further information.
In conclusion, I wasn't at all satisfied, and I would like my money back since the show wasn't worth it.

Pat was my friend, I trusted her and we got on very well untill she had repeated to everyone the secret I had told her. There was only one thing I didn't like with her: she could do anything to have friends, even betray me.
No one knew apart from me and my mother. I kept lying when somebody asked where my dad was. ""He's travelling around the world "" I would say, and everyone would admire him. But know Pat knew, and because of her, so did everyone else: he was in prison because he had killed a man.
Since everyone knew the truth, things weren't the same. Everyone, even my friends, looked at me in a strange kind of way. As if I was guilty. What did I have to do with this? I wasn't the one who had killed the man, but it seemed people didn't want to talk to me anymore.

First of all, the show is far away from being the best musical show in London. I was very exited to see it yesterday, but as soon as I arrived at the theater the problems began. I was looking forward on having a discount of some pounds on my ticket, as the leaflet says, however it did not happen. After that, I became even more angry because, as far as I concerne, the show must begin on time, but it started forty five minutes late. Finally, the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but others I have never seeing before, and the restaurant was closed with no advise.
At last, for all these reasons my evening was horrible, and that is why I would like to ask you for my money back as soon as possible.

I went to the Circle Theatre yesterday, to see the play ""Over The Rainbow"" and I must say that I got rather disappointed.
First of all, the play was supposed to start at 7:30 P.M. but it actually started only at 8:15 P.M. so I had to wait forty-five minutes. Also, your advertisement sign says that discounts are available. What is quite not true because when I asked for it, the woman who sells the tickets replied with a resounding "" no "".
When the play finally started, and the two actors entered the stage, I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook, differently from what the advertisement sign says, what really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play.
But my complaints are not over yet. After the disappointing performance the actor who replaced Danny Brook, I went to the theatre restaurant, and, also differing from the advertisement sign, it was closed. There was only a small sign stamped on the door, saying that it was ""closed for repairs"".
So, unfortunately, I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had, and given the reasons, I expect to count with your sense of responsability, so, I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds spent on that terrible night.

I am writing to your to complain about the musical show called ""Over the rainbow""
As a matter of fact, I waited for seeing Danny Brook who I appreciate a lot and I was very disappointed that he wasn't here. Besides, the actor who filled him in was unknown and specially boring.
Secondly, the show had to begin at 19.30 pm, in fact he began at 20.15 pm and that without any explainations!
Your advertisement mentioned that discounts were available, however when I asked for them to the staff they replied to me that they weren't discounts!
After the show, I wanted to visit your restaurant and once again, I was disappointed because it was closed. Anybody could explain to me why!
I can assure you that it wasn't a perfect evening out and I got very annoyed about this evening which could have been wonderful.
That is the reason I would like you to refund my money. I hope you would take notice of this complaint seriously. I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Firstly, the actor suppossed to be Danny Brook, but he was not, it was another actor, who I have never seen before, so, as you can imagen, I was very disappointed.
Another complain is about the time that the musical show started, the advertisement said it started at 19:30, but it did not, we had to wait 45 minutes. It was terrible.
Now, about the tickets, the were different prices but there were not discounts, and because of this, many people could not see the show, especially students.
Finally, when the musical show finished, and I have to say, a bit late, I went to the theatre's restaurant to eat something but this place was closed because the chef had already gone.
At is explain it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back because of the reasons that I mentioned before.

Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she did, but Pat refused to apologaising to her, because she felt it wasn't a mistake and she did it for only one reason: help Maria to get the man that she loved.

For me the most disappointing problem was that the starring Danny Brook wasn't there. My husband was also looking forward to seeing Mr. Brook as an actor of your musical because he is one of his greatest fans. The actor which acted instead of Danny Brook wasn't as good as Mr. Brook.
After the show, which wasn't really the best I have ever seen, my family and I wanted to get some snacks in the theatre restaurant. When we arrived at the restaurant we had to realize that it was closed because the cook was ill. After this last we went home with only bad remembers of this evening.

I'm writing to you because of the musical show ""Over the rainbow"", wich I visited on Friday the 16th of June in your theatre. There are several points I have to complain wich made the evening not nice at all.
At first the show started much later than it was written out. Instead of half past seven the show startet at quarter past eight. I couldn't go to have a refreshment because of two reasons, the first one is that there was no information how much time the start of the show is going to be late. The second reason is that the restaurant of the theatre was closed because of building plans for the next two month.
After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I had to realize that the main actor Danny Brook, who was the reason why I went into the show had been traded by an other actor, who couldn't sing as half as good then Brook.
On your ticket information is written out that discounts are available, when I ask at the ticket reception I couldn't get any discount for beeng student.

Last week, during my holiday in London, I had the opportunity to see the show ""Over the Rainbow"" at the Circle Theathre. That is why I am writing this letter; to inform you about the problems I had.
First of all, the tickets were too expensive. I was told that there were some discounts to students, but at the moment I bought the ticket, they charged me a full price.
The day of the show, we got to the theather at 19:30. Instead, due to some technical problems, it began at 20:15.
Second, I was really disappointed when I found out that Danny Brook, the best actor I have never known and the reason for which I decided to see the show, was not going to be performing.
Third, the theatre restaurant was closed because the cheff did not show up. I was really looking forward to eating at that place.
In conclusion, I would appreciate if you could, please, send me my money back because I did not have the perfect evening that I expected.

She didn't want to tell the teachers at school or any other person because she was afraid that if her stepfather find out about that, he would get made and hit her, or even worse, kill her mother.
However, she needed to tell somebody. One morning somebody knocked at the door at Sally's house. It was the police. Sally was so scared, and at the same time mad at Pat because she knew the only person who could have told the police was her best friend.

Dear Sir or Madam,
About two weeks ago, I went to London for a week holiday. While there I saw your advertisement for the show ""Over the rainbow"" and decided to go.
I was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, it was not exactly the case: there were no discounts available, as it was mentionned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; I was then very disappointed to see that Danny Brook was replaced by someone else.
After the show was over, it was not possible to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed that day.
I am very sorry to say it was definitely not a perfect evening out, and I am therefore asking you a refund of the amount I paid, or part of it. You will find the receipt enclosed.

Dear Sir
I'm writing to complain about an evening I spent in your theatre to see a musical show. According to your brochure, it was supposed to be the perfect evening out; instead of that I had a very disappointing evening.
Firstly, the actors weren't those announced. Indeed, instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove; we had mean actors.
As for the times, the show was supposed to begin at 19.30 whereas in reality it began at 20.15.
Likewise, there were no discounts avalaible.
To end, in spite of being opened, the restaurant was closed for reparations.
Because of all those inconvenients, I ask you a total refund. I'm sure you will accept my request; if not I intend to take legal actions against your company. You may contact me at my home address whenever you wish.

Dear Sir/Madam:
I am writing to complain about the musical show: Over the Rainbow, presented in your theatre on 15th of June.
I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to have a discount as I was a student. However, the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had been sold out. I could not understand why but still bought the ticket because I was crazy about Danny Brook. Then, I went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry for waiting until 20:15, forty-five minutes after the expected starting time. Furthermore, I was so disappointed to find out that Danny Brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so bad that I left the theatre before it finished. At last, I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it needed cleaning.
I think it was definitely not a perfect evening as garenteed in your advertisement. I look forward to having a full refund in the very near future as I did not enjoy it at all.

Being on a holiday trip in London, I dreamed to go to the theatre for a musical show. I saw your advertisement last Monday, and thought ""It is that one that I want to try.""
In fact, your musical show was attractive: actors, time, restaurant, discount tickets, and also the title! I started to be OK with the ""Your perfect evening out"", sure not to be deceived.
But all was disappointing! First, as I am very found of Danny Brook, I have been surprised he totally changed his voice, face, and so on! It was not Danny on the scene! Second bad point: beeing, I accept other actors.. but if the show begin on time - he began at a quarter past eight P.M.
There were no discount places because it was not planed like this. What was written on the advertisement?
The was reached when I saw the restaurant was closed for ""holidays"".

I'm writing this letter to you, because during my stay in London, I went to the theatre to see a musical show, and I had a very disappointing evening.
Last Saturday I went to see ""Over the Rainbow"". When I read the advertisement, I noticed that Danny Brook acted in this musical show. I appreciated him a lot. When the show started forty-five minutes later, I realised that the main actor had been changed. That change really disappointed me. Another problem was that I didn't have any discount, and I wasn't alone, we were five persons. Our idea after the show, was to visit the theatre restaurant, but it was closed. Nobody could give me an answer. I really had an awful evening.
Please send me a letter, with the explanations for all these problems that I told you. Next time, be more careful with what you put in your advertisement.
I'm looking forward to receiving your letter.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good a keeping secrets. That night my parents went out, so I had to stay home with Pat. I invited my best friends, and I asked Christian to bring some videos. We left Pat in her room with those videos, and we went to the top of the house, the third floor.
That room was totally dark. We went upstairs with only a candle, and the idea of planning something crazy.
Manuel had a farm, no so long from the town, where we could do whatever we wanted. But what was the problem. We were too young to stay a hole weekend alone. I thought of the idea of telling our parents that we had a camping with the school. We were all agree. We were going to spend a weekend alone, with nobody else, playing football, going to bed at the time we wanted, talking about girls. It was perfect.
We were very calm, discussing the last details of our weekend, when we heard a noise that came out from a room that was near us. Manuel opened the door, and there she was, Pat with Ramiro's sister hearing all our conversation.","['R', 'RY', 'RY', 'RP', 'RV', 'SX', 'MV', 'UD', 'DJ', 'UY', 'MP', 'RV']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I went to London last week for business and loving very much theatre I had promised my friend to offer her, after work, a very good evening with your musical show: ""Over the Rainbow"".
I had read about it that was a very enjoyable show! What a surprise!
Your advertisement was a quite lie and I have to tell you my disappointment. Every point were wrong. (I wondered if it was a fake!)
At first, from your advert Danny Brook (who is a very good singer I appreciate very much) was not here. An unknown man was singing, not in tone - awful for my ears - (poor Tina Truelove! such a professional singer with a beginner!)
At second, to go on with the beginning, your show started not at 19.30 but nearly one hour later (20.15 to be more precise!)
And for the third point, I would hope to offer a good diner to my friend because I knew your restaurant as a famous place but I was still disappointed. It was closed for some improvements!
I hope you will understand my evening was detestable and you will give me back my money.
I join this letter my two tickets.
I am looking forward to hearing from you

I was very young when this story happened but though it was a child's adventure I remember it yet. I was just thirteen years old!
I had read a very good book about pirates and I know I got a very creative imagination. my parents lived in a small village near a wonderful country.
Like my heros I would like to live in a ship and decided to build something in a tree. The highest tree near a river I have ever seen. Peaceful place and wonderful view.
With my friend Pat ( I put him in the confidence ) I started to work and my idea became real.
It was our fortress and every day we could improve it. The tree was our ship and the river the sea. We could play hours and hours without seeing an adult or other children from the village. I prefered it. It was our secret Pat and I. Child's secret.
But Pat could not keep it too long. He had a fault: he talked a lot and told an other friend our story. What a catestrophee! All children went from the village and wanted to play with us. I accepted them but I was very angry against Pat. Our quietness disappeared and very fast everybody wanted to command my ship. A desaster!
There was lots of fights between us and we were naughty like child could be with other child.
The result was my ship was destroyed and never more I could trust in any friend!","['ID', 'RY', 'RV', 'R', 'UD', 'RN', 'IN', 'MP', 'TV', 'MD', 'R', 'ID', 'MT', 'MQ', 'RV', 'IV', 'MP', 'MD', 'RY', 'RP', 'RN', 'S', 'MD', 'RV', 'UT', 'RT', 'RN', 'RY', 'S', 'AGV', 'AGN', 'TV', 'AGN', 'RY', 'W']",0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,3,4,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

Last week I spent my holiday in London and I've seen your musical ""Over the rainbow' in the Circle Theatre and I was really disappointed. When I read the advertisment for the show I was really excited but after the show I was not very happy because of the following problems.
The advertisment says that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because I was looking forward to them. The times were also not alright, actually the show starts at 19.30 but in this evening it started at 20.15. The advertisment also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none.
Usually I go to a restaurant after theatre but this was also not possible because your theatre restaurant was closed because of holiday. Why do you give those information in an advertisment.
For me it was really not a perfect evening, I was expecting a nice evening but in fact it was terrible.
Because of these problems I had I would like to ask for a compensation, maybe to get my money back. I hope you understand my complains. I wish you answer me soon.

Of course, it changes, it became normal to have a mobile phone or to use mainly the computer and the internet. It becomes more and more easier to use the computer for everything.

With the reference of the advertisement published in the New Strait Times newspaper on the 22nd of MAY 2000, I, as a consumer, who is a musical show avid and a great fans of Danny Brook, who is said to be stared in the show, would like to complain about the presentation.
1. First of all, I was really furious of watching a show starring by a different actor, instead of Danny Brook. whose name was stated on the advertisement. Besides this, the show started almost 45 minutes later than what it was said to be.
2.. However, I was completely disappointed when I was told that there were not any discounts for the show.
3. I also found out that the theatre restaurant was not opened after the show due to. I was really hungry after the show and was pissed off.
With all the above points, I would like to ask for some money return. I would consider to bring this complains to the court if I do not receive any agreeable explaination from the theatre. Thank You.

When I first heard about Over the Rainbow I was very exited about the idea of seeing it, plus when I heard about the facilities that the circle theatre was giving, it becomed the best oportunity I ever had to asist to a musical of that category, but instead of being the best evening I ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why I am writting to you.
Like I have already told you, instead of being the perfect evening, it was the worst I ever had. First, the actors that the Circle theatre publis in their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not, which was very disappointing because, the actors were starring the musical, was one of it mayor attractions. Another point that I want to comply about, is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was a mayor unsatisfaction about it, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered that your food was unhealthy, and not considering many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.

My name is Lisa and I'm 21 years old. I went to the theatre last Friday to see Over the Rainbow and I felt disappointed about the musical. I expected more from it. First of all the actor was the same since last semester. I would really like to see a new one such as Markin Davis, he is a great actor and he would fit well this musical. Then I was sitted with my friend just waiting for the start that lasted forever and was supposed to start at 19:30. After the show I felt really hungry, so I meant to go to the restaurant which was closed. By the time I thought: ""I want my money back."" That was supposed to be a perfect evening turned out to be the most hateful musical I've ever seen.

Modern technology has changed a lot our daily life.
On one hand nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return in the same day you can take a plane without any problem. In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day.
Another advantage is that if you go on an excursion and you take your mobile phone, if you get lost somebody could find you.
I think that the most important modern technology in these days is internet. With internet you can do whatever you want without going out home ( shoping, speaking with a friend, working, putting your money aside....)
On the other hand the main disadvantage is that using modern machines it can be very difficult for ederly people; it would be very if the modern industries train people about using modern technologies.

Dear Tim,
I'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where ""The old man and the Sea"" by Earnest Hemingway will be read. I recommend you listen to it! As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us. I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us? Therefore Hemingway is a very good example. He fought in the Spanish Civil war and in World War II always on the search for answers to questions like ""... what defines a man"", or ""... what happens to us in critical situations"". These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books. One of the most interesting ones is ""The old man and the Sea"". A story of an old seaman leaving his town to proove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught. The story describes his feelings, thoughts, fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish. In the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to ""sacrifice"" his fish to attacking sharks. So did he finally win or loose? An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway's work and what he meant by ""pace under pressure"".
I hope you will enjoy it! Please let me know!
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

Well I seems to me that you should know what had happened there.
First of all, I read your advertisement where it was written that the musical show started at 19.30, but do you know at what hour it started? It started at 20:15! Don't you think it is a lack of respect? Really it was.
I forgot to tell you that there were no available discounts. And tickets were too expensive! Most people couldn't afford them.
As a matter of fact, when the musical show was over, I was really hungry. But as I had read your advertisement I knew there was a restaurant. So I went there in order to have something to eat. But can you believed it, it was closed. Absolutely closed. So I asked someone who seemed to be in charge, and he told me that it was too late to have a meal. This really disappoint me. I was both hungry and angry.
Well I think that is all, but I will ask you to give my money back.
Looking forward hearing from you.

I was attending college, as I normally do. With nothing to lose, at all, but on the contrary, with a lot to learn from.
I was very keen on English lessons, maybe because I was sitting near the Boy I loves. Yes, I think this was the only reason. His name was Cody. He was a very handsome and good looking boy. But far from that, he was a very kind person.
Pat told me that he was also in love with me. He told me that it was nessary to do something about. But I didn't know what to do.
Pat suggested me to talk to him. But I really didn't managed to do so.
As Pat was lossing his patience, he decided to talk to him. I can say that I was very nervious or anxious about what was going to happen. He didn't kept my secret.
Pat told him that I was in love with him. This was my secret and now it was not. But so, I think it was for the best, he was also in love with me.

Dear Sir,
Last weekend, I have been in London with my friend and I saw your musical show ""over the Rainbow"".
I write this letter to you for explain my very bad evening I have passed in theatre. On the paper it was writting the principal actor is ""Danny Brook"" but it wasn't him, it was a different actor that we have never seen, and heard. I think it's really not correct.
They haven't respect the timetable, the show had to begun at 19:30 and he started at 20:15 how can you explain this fault?!
But it's not finish you wrote on the paper ""Discounts available"" but it wasn't true, it was a very badly organisation. After this bad show we had want to go to the Restaurant for drunk and ate something and it was closed and nobody had explained us why the Restaurant wasn't open.
So, I'm very angry when I think about this evening, and I want to have my money back. I think it's the minimum you have to do for me.

I am writing to you to complain about the musical show Over the rainbow. My wife and me went to The Circle Theatre last Saturday evening because we love the main actor, Danny Brook. We felt very disappointed when we discovered that Danny had been replaced by an unknown and really bad actor.
The show should have started at half past seven but we had to wait for forty-five minutes without any kind of explanation.
Not only was the show late and awful but it was expensive too. The advertisement said there were discounts available but when we arrived there the woman who sells the tickets told us the discounts were only available on Monday evenings.
Despite the terrible evening we decided to go to the theatre restaurant to relax and have dinner, but we found it was closed because its floor was being repaired.
As you can see it wasn't a perfect evening at all!
That is why I am writing to you. I want you to give our money back because the things published in your advertisement aren't true. There should be no problem as I still have the tickets.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Matt:
It's been a long time since I last wrote you!
I'm always very busy traveling from one country to another, you know.
I'm writing to you now because I've been told that is going to be read on the radio a short story by Agatha Christie. It will be the following Sunday on the local station at five o'clock in the evening.
It's a story titled Accident, and I think you'll enjoy it.
The story is about the life in a small village. The main character is a retired police inspector who recognises a woman.
That woman is supposed to have killed her husbands (at least two), because she wanted their money.
The policeman lets her know he has discovered her and he won't allow another crime. He threatens to tell her husband what she had done. However, she's a very clever woman and she doesn't look worried.
In the end, the three of them are having a cup of coffee and one of the cups contains a terrible poison. There will be a horrible accident in a few seconds.
Listen to the radio if you want to know how it ends.
Drop me a line and let me know what do you make of the story.
Best wishes,","['MT', 'IV', 'W', 'R', 'RJ', 'UD', 'UV']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0

We have spent a week's holiday in London and wanted to see a musical show. We read an advertisement about your musical show, starred by the well-known Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in a local newspaper
We were very disappointed to hear that the actor was replaced by other at the last minute. The advertisement said that it starts at 19.30, but it started actually at 20:15 due to the probleme of the sound. We were also surprised to discover that the student discounts wasn't available for us, because they didn't accept our student indentity card from Switzerland.

I am writing to complain about your musical show. I am not really satisfied about it. Lots of information in your advertisement are not correct. Some problems of organisation seem to be appeared.
Firstly, I hoped to have a relaxing entertainment with your musical show but it was not the case. In your advertisement you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. They were replaced by less famous actors. Unfortunately, the musical show was annoying. I was terribly disappointed. Moreover, it started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 as you had written on it. I had to wait for 45 minutes without nothing doing. I would you informed us before.
Secondly, furthermore I had to pay full price whereas you granted us some discount prices. I was very interested in visiting your theatre restaurant after the show but it seemed to me it was closed. Your assistant prevented us from visiting it because it was too late and he was so busy.
Finally, you thought that you could grant us a perfect evening but it was not true. Consequently, I would like you refund my bill.
I look forward to hearing from you.

During my holiday in London I decided to go to the theatre. I found your advertisement in the tourism officis and how the musical ""Over the rainbow"" seemed to be a good option I choose it.
The problem is that there was some differences between the advertisement and the show I've seen. First, Danny Brook wasn't the star that night, he was replaced by an actor that seemed a rookie. Another problem, the show started at 20:15 in the place of 19:30 and when it finished I couldn't have a dinner because the theatre's restaurant was closed (it closes at 22:00). Moreover, there wasn't any discounts availables (I'm student but I paid a full ticket).
and I want to be refund.

I'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you present at the moment: ""Over the Rainbow"".
As my husband is a native and we live in Switzerland, we apreciate to pass a week in London every year. We are keen on theatre and musical show. Your theatre is known to present excellent spectacles. We were never disappointed so far and especially enjoyed ""The Drama"" you presented last year.
Anyway we had a very disappointing evening. At first, we couldn't get any discount, although you mention it on your advertisment. And the only tickets left were at £20. Then the spectacle began 45 minutes later than mentioned. Last but not least, Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, whose name I probably forgot because of his poor performance. Afterwards we are used to eat at your restaurant which is not only well known for it's good price value but also for it's original decoration.
Therefore I ask you to give use £20 back, because the two tickets were not more worth. I'm looking forward to hearing soon from you.

Secondly the show had go on 19.30 pm. In fact it started at 20.15 pm without any explanations.
Thirdly it said that ""discounts available"". This is not the truth.
After that it suggested to visit your theatre restaurant, but the restaurant was closed! It is a shame.
And you write, I quote ""your perfect evening out"", excuse me but I do not agree with you. It was awful, the worst evening out of my life.

In my opinion, clothes will not change so much, because fashion is an eternal cycle. You will find always basic clothes, but I think that it will be the materials which will change.
We will find the same kind of clothes with gadgets included. For example: a short very classical inside of it could be included a mobile phone, or we could find too some buttons, to have.. fresh air, why not? Or special flying shoes, and maybe on your watch you would have a screen to watch your favorite soap operas.
Everything is possible, but it would be fun to see this type of gadgets with old clothes, like a dress of the middle-Age.

Dear Mr Smith,
, I would like to inform you that I've assisted your new musical show, which name is ""Over the rainbow"", last Saturday evening, 10th June. I'm writing you to make a complaint on your advertisement, which I consider like a lying advertisement. Let me explain you why I'm now so disappointed. I've spent one week holiday in London with my husband for our honeymoon. We had preparred quiet a long time ago, this travel to the capital and spared a lot of money as well.
We are both very keen on musical shows. We've already attended ""Cats"", the ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""les Miserables"", ""Grease"", and so many others. When we saw your leaflet mentionned ""London's newest and best musical show"", we were so enthusiastic and curious that we bought immediately the tickets. On the waiting evening, at the entrance stood people, who were shouting at you because there wasn't any discounts available. One thing that you promised on your leaflet. We didn't have trouble to find our seats, but we found very annoying to have waited 45 minutes before the show goes on and more that your famous actors weren't absolutely Mr Brook and Mrs Truelove and we can also add that your restaurant wasn't opened because of hygienic troubles. I can say now that ""It wasn't my perfect evening out"" and I request now some money back for all these disagreements.

Dear Sir or Madam,
Please find enclosed my thinking about the fashion of the future. First of all, I think we should consider the manner actually to see how it's going to be developped into the future. Everyone has is own style but it's obvious that many of us is wearing the same clothes like others. We all follow the new collection on the market. Today it's wearing short-trousers and yesterday was wearing broken-jeans. What we wear is also influenced by models, medias, or new collection, which come from Paris, London, or New York. These new clothes are often very expensive that's not everyone can afford to buy himself the newest clothes on the market. In 100 years, it's possible that each people will developp his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex everything possible, in a way to create own clothes.
In my opinion, I think that people will wear no clothes anymore, just being natural, nude and feeling free, like many many years before. Because, I think that people need to find again their authenticity.

THE CIRCLE THEATRE
LONDON
Dear Sir,
I am writing you to complain about the musical show which took place the last 1st of May in ""the Circle Theatre"" in London. Your show was supposed to be one of the best that I had ever seen. At first sight the theatre was gorgeous, I was surprised of its facade and also I was anxious for the beginning of the performance.
My friends and me thought that it would be the perfect night in London but everything changed when the show had been delayed more than forty-five minutes.
Although we had problems at the entrance with the tickets, we looked forward for that marvellous night. The prices that our travel agency confirmed us were not the same as the theatre, we asked for our special discount for be students with less than eighteen years but we only obtained a rudely answer of the woman who sold the tickets.
In addition to this, we realized when the show began that the main character was not Danny Brook.
At top of everything the restaurant was closed and we could not eat on the theatre.
You can imagine how upset we were and we asked you for our reward for the night that we spent.
Yours Faithful","['MT', 'UD', 'RT', 'RP', 'RT', 'R', 'RA', 'MY', 'TV', 'RT', 'RD', 'MT', 'M', 'RP', 'FV', 'RT', 'DJ', 'RT', 'ID', 'RT', 'TV', 'UD', 'MQ', 'RN', 'M', 'DY']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,2,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Firstly, in the advertisement you said that Dany Brook was going to be starring in the play, but you've placed another actor in his place, which was very disappointing.

We had to wait all that time without someone to explain us the reason for this delay.
To make matters worse, your theatre restaurant was closed and one of your assistants said that.

The biggest achievement of modern technology has broken into my house as soon as I was at the age of ten. This achievement is the personal computer, which has grown very fast, because of the help it can provide. My computer helps me in my studies, homeworks and projects for school. With the Internet, I got more socialised using the Relay Chat clients, but also got a kind of boredom, which is known as ""Internet Freak Disease""! I use it a lot so sometimes I feel pain in my eyes or my hands.
Moreover, fishing was affected by the modern technology. Fishing is my hobby and that's why I bought these plastic worms and fish, that are not so good - it's better to use alive worms!

I am writing to you complaining for the Play you are advertising as the ""London's Newest and Best Musical Show"" in newspapers and leaflets. To tell you the truth, it has been the most disappointing experience in my whole life. I cannot bear when somebody says something and then does just the opposit way.
To begin with, I would like to inform you, in case you do not know that the play does not start at 19.30 as it says. What is more it lasted 45 minutes of waiting to start and did not supply all the expectations people had.
On the other hand, despite the fact that you said that it was starring by Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, I must tell you that Danny Brook did not appear at all. Instead of him there was another actor who neither act nor sing, and, even though, it was a Musical Show.
The last thing I would like to complain for is that the Theatre Restaurant was closed because, as it said, of ""VACATIONS"". If in the advertisements and leaflets says ""VISIT OUR THEATRE RESTAURANT AFTER THE SHOW"" there are not reasons for being closed. It should be opened at least until all people gets out of the place. It must be our decission whether to stay and eat there, or not.
To make it shorter, because of everything I have said before, the correct thing to do for me is to ask for my money back, and for you is just giving it back to me because of all the troubles and disappointings feeling you made me suffer.

In times of our grandparents life was so different, that we cannot beleive that this huge change to our day life happened in only one hundred years or less.
First, we have to admit that technology has really increased the access to communication, traveling and geting information. You can now know what happens on the other side of the world, at the same time it is happening. What is more, you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the ""enter"" key in a computer.
Furthermore, as we all know, day life now a days is quite simplier and an example of this is that instead of buying a peice of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and cooler. Strange as it seems, we now can have every machine or especialized technology to make our dayly life more confortable and less workable. Things that human beings used to do, now are being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly.
One the other hand, despite the fact that technology make things easier in our day life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people. As people do not get a job because is not needed they get into poorness, criminal activities, being isolated and without the possibility of getting a good education. This is the most terribly disadvantage technology has.

Firstly, the actors were different from the ones written in the advertisement which was very disappointing for me.

I am writing to make a complaint about the Circle Theatre. I recently went there to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I was very disapointed to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true.
For example, the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor, but he was not. Instead, there was this unknown actor with a very bad performance and a terribly annoying voice. Moreover, the play did not start at the time it was supposed to. I had to wait for forty five minutes. All the waiting made me quite hungry, so I was expecting to have good meal at the theatre restaurant after the show. However, it was closed for cleaning.
All these problems spoiled my evening and frustrated me, since I was expecting to see a good play, so I expect a full refund. By the way, why weren't any discounts available for the tickets, as it was said in the advertisement?

We were told that this was a great show, and we decided to see how it was. If the show was as good as we were told we should save our final night for it, this was going to be the end of our vacation, a great one by the way.
When our final day arrived, we went shoping in the morning and then we went to the hotel to change our clothes and get ready for the show.
When we arrived, the were a lot of people, the pace was beatiful, all seemed perfect. When we entrance the place our problems begun. First, there were no discount on the tickets but that was fine. Then, the show had a great delay, almost an hour, we deal with that too. After that they changed the principal actor, the one that replaced him was very bad, that made us realy angry. But that isn't all, to complete this tragedy the restaurant was closed.

Dear Sir,
I am writing to complain about your show ""Over the rainbow"" and the conditions in which it is held.
I was having a week's holiday in London when I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical show. I had read your advertisement in a morning newspaper and the show seemed very attractive to me. Moreover an English friend of mine had told me that it would purely be a good show as Danny Brook was a very good actor.
So on Saturday, June 7, I was there for the 7:30 pm show and here are my reasons for complaining. Firstly, there were no discounts available as stated in your advertisement, not even for students, and I had to pay for a full-price ticket. Secondly, we had to wait until 8:00 pm before being able to have a seat and the show finally beginned at 8:15!
No need to say how much I was disappointed to see that another actor was performing instead of Danny Brook and the actor didn't seem to have rehearsed the role very much. At the end of the show, I decided to have dinner in your theatre restaurant and I went there... just to find out that it was closed because it was being newly painted.
To sum up, it was not the ""perfect evening out!"" you advertised. So I am asking you to pay me back at least half of the ticket price for the inconvenience that was caused to me. I hope that you will understand my request and reply to me in a positive way by sending me a cheque to my address in France (see the letterhead).
Looking forward to receiving your reply very soon.

We were both in the same class in high school and used to spend a lot of time together; we were actually very good friends and had no secrets for each other.
At that time, I used to buy a lotery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts. One day, while I was checking my weekly ticket, I found out that I had five numbers out of six so that I would surely get a substancial amount of money.
I had to wait ten days before the lotery head office would give me the cheque and one week before I could learn how much I had won. But I was too excited to keep it secret so I told Pat that I had won a prize for five correct numbers and had her swear not to tell anyone.
But soon everyone in the class was looking at me smillingly and I find out that I had many unsuspected friends... No longer after, they were asking me to pay a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed to go shopping, others to go to the cinema and the restaurant. Well, they all seemed to be so different and behaved in such an unusual way each time they saw me that I began to think that they knew something about me.
Endly came the end of the week and I went to the lotery office to check the amount I had won. I was very disappointed to learn that I'd only won three hundred francs for many people had found five numbers like me.

I am waiting this letter re fearing to the show ""over the Rainbow"" you presented the 10 of this month.
I read your advertissement five days before, and I was realy impressed by it. But, the quality of this show wasn't what you let understand, an I feel realy disappointed by it. I want to give you some details about my feelings.
First of all, you presented a starring composed with Danny Brook, but he wasn't there! Secondly, the show should start at 19.30, and in fact it started 45 minutes late. Then, I am a student, and when I bought my ticket, there wasn't any discounts. Finally, I hoped that I could have a diner in the restaurant after the show, but, to make my totally disappointed, it was closed, and I had to find another restaurant at 22.00.
So you can imagine how I am satisfied by your pretending ""Perfect Evening"".

Firstly, we got our tickets in your ticket office just one hour before the show. We thought, as usual we do in London theatre, we could have discounts as it's written on your advertisement. Surprisily, there were no discounds.
Secondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, it's a theatre but not a concert hall!!!!
Thirdly, we were astonished about the actors whose we know from others musical. Why did you not change the name of your advertisement?
In the end, the restaurant was closed because you didn't have enough staffs, this evening!!. We really like London, the people, the night-life but this evening was really awful.
I sent to you a copie of our tickets. Would you pleased return our money back. In advance, thank you.

Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another, unkown actor who starred instead of him.
Another point which caused some was the timetable of the show. It began 45 minutes later than it should have been.
Notwithstanding the fact that I could have expected a discount for my ticket, it occuried to be impossible to have one.

Mr. Smith,
I write to you because last night, (Saturday 10), I went to see the musical show that you are presenting at the Circle theatre.
I am a great fan of Danny Brook and went to see him in his new show, but, to my surprise, it wasn't him who played that night but another horrible young actor. I went with my daughter, a university student, and she was supposed to have a discount on the ticket. We asked for it and we were told that there was not discount neither for her not for anyone else, so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets.
Furthermore, it was announced to start at 19.30 p.m. and it started at 20.15 p.m. for reasons anyone would explain to the audience.
After the play, we went to the theatre's restaurant and we found out that it was closed since 1999's spring! How can you ask the people to go to a closed restaurant?
In conclusion, I would be very grateful if you could send me my money back because, as you have seen, I didn't spend the ""perfect evening"" you announce.

Every day after having dinner Pat, his best friend, and my grandpa met to talk about their problems, but my Grandpa never told Pat about his new project.
One month later, his worked was complete, but he was afraid of testing his machine, so he called Pat and spoke about it.
The only thing Pat should do, was to choose a date, the one he likes and to press the starter botton, and you know, what, he did it! The machine worked really good.
The fact was that Pat choose to go to the year 2000, and when he arrived, he told every one that he was the inventor. That's why Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.

Dear Sir/Madam,
I recently had a week's holiday in London, so I went to the theatre to see a musical show 'Over the Rainbow' at 'The Circle Theatre', where you are the manager.
I had a terrible evening, so there were a lot of faults in the event of last Saturday: The first point, the show started at 20:15 (it was too late). The second point, the principal actor was changed. The third point was that the discounts tickets were unavailable and finally, the theatre restaurant was closed because the oven was broken and we couldn't enjoy there after the musical show.
I would be grateful if you could send a money back because it was a horrible evening for my family and it wasn't a perfect evening out.

To take my personal example, I would be no able to live without some of the most recent discoveries, which make my daily life easier. For instance, I can't imagine living without using a computer to write my scholar works, to play a game or to order some goods on the Internet. This latter is a new which has changed my life, as it is a marvellous tool to communicate, learn or have fun. Another important change related to the modern technology are the credit cards.

To make the evening worse the tickets were not, and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show because it was so late when the show was over.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and he usually makes up some extra information.
On day we decided to write a special letter to Pat; in the letter we told him that we felt in love, we were a beautiful girl with long hair and green eyes ( as Pat likes women ). The only problem was that the girl was to shy to speak to him, she wanted to keep her name in secret, and if Pat tells someone something about the letter, she won't say who is.
Poor Pat, he was so happy because a girl loves him and so nervous at the same time, even eating his nails. As I said at the beginning Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so he told us that he had a love letter but we couldn't read it. Three days after we sent him another letter, and Pat told us again but we said, "" oh Pat don't tell that lie again"", so Pat got furious and showed us the letter. We laughed and explained him that we were who wrote that letters, and made him promises that when he gets a secret lover, a real one, don't tell anyone because he won't meet her.","['TV', 'R', 'TV', 'RV', 'R', 'W', 'SX', 'R', 'TV', 'TV', 'MA', 'TV', 'TV', 'RV', 'R', 'RP', 'MP', 'MA', 'MT', 'MD', 'MA', 'RD', 'FV', 'MA', 'RV', 'M']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

After a few seconds of thoughts I went straigh to Pat. ""Why, why did you do that?"" I said she looked as if she didn't want to talk to me. I ignored her I couldn't do anything now. Everybody knew about my party and I had invited only ten persons. I was confused. I wondered why I made the mistake to invite Pat. I guess I didn't know that she would have said it.
After a big confusion I decided not to make a party for my birthday so I could had all my friends back. And that's what I had done even if I stayed alone at my birthday. It was much more important to me to get all my friends back.

I am writing to complain about the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" which I saw in your theatre the 5th of June. I have been very disappointed by the quality of the show and the lies in your advertisement.
Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, as written in the advertisement, but his part was played by another actor, without information or excuse from the direction. Secondly, I coudn't get a discount with my student card and the show started 45 minutes later. In addition, the theatre restaurant, where we had planned to eat, was closed because the cook was ill.
I am therefore asking for a complete refund of my ticket and I hope you will improve the quality of your services in the future.

I am writting this letter to inform you I had a very disappointing evening during your musical show ""Over the rainbow"" at the Circle Theatre where you are the director.
First of all, the actor was expected to be Danny Brook. He is my favourite actor and the most important reason I went to your theatre. But finally, without telling us anything, there was a different actor. This was very disappointing.
Secondly, your famous restaurant was closed. That was very displeasured because I had planned a romantic dinner with my wife. If you had told me your restaurant was going to be closed, I would have made a reservation anywhere else, but you didn't.
And finally the play started with a delay of forty-five minutes and there were not discounts available. Both things do not agree with what I read on your advertising sign.
Due to all of these reasons, I hope you could give my money back.

Hello Sir,
"" Um very unpleased that I have to write you this letter. I have to do this because things happened which I can't ignore and which disappointed me very much.
On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine. We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical ""Over the Rainbow"" in the ""Circle Theater "". We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets, but when we arrived, a long line of people were standing there, waiting to get tickets. After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the points because, I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't play! So when the miserable musical came to his end, we were happy to leave the theater room, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no restaurantes were opened anymore, because it started too late. So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a short sign on a door: ""Sorry, we are closed because of renovations""! We thought it would be a joke, but it wasn't. Because you are the manager, I think you are the only person who can change something. I would prefer getting my money back, instead of taking a lawyer. I will never visit your theatre again!
Sincerely
Hedwiga Heinkel","['S', 'RJ', 'RT', 'SA', 'MP', 'RN', 'R', 'UP', 'RV', 'AGD', 'SA', 'RN', 'IN', 'DJ', 'MV', 'RJ', 'RT', 'UV', 'TV', 'RA', 'FV', 'RV']",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,2,2,0,0,2,2,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Dear Sir,
I'm writing to you to make complaints for the very disappointing evening I had at the Circle Theatre.
Firstly, I found that there were no discounts as it was announced in the advertisement.
Then, I not only had to wait 45 minutes more than it was expected for the beginning of the show but I realised that the main actor had been replaced by another one (very bad) as well. Of course I must tell you that the strongest reason for my going to see the show was Danny Brook's presence.
Finally, after the show, I went to the theatre restaurant just to find that it was closed and the friend I had asked to meet me there was not waiting for me. As if that was not enough he thought I had been kidding, inviting him to a closed restaurant where I didn't appear.
Those were the reasons for my asking a refund of the £20 I paid.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.

I refer to your advertisment in the Herald Tribune where you advertised for the Circle Theatre and the recent musical: Over the Rainbow.
On Saturday, June 5th, 2000 my wife and I wanted to spend a nice and enjoyable evening and decided to go and see the musical.
When we arrived at the theatre we had to realise that there were no discountable tickets available as mentioned in your advertisment so we had to buy the most expensive ones. After that one of the theatre assistants told us that the film would have began at 20:15 o'clock instead of 19:30 o'clock as indicated. So we had to arrest for a while and had a drink.
To make the matters worse Danny Brook who was announced as one of the starring person in the musical was not acting this evening. You can imagine how disappointed we were especially the acting of Danny Brook was the main reason for us to see the musical.
On top of this we intend to go to the theatre restaurant which was closed because of building activities.
As you can imagine we were very disappointed and it wasn't a perfect evening out I would like to have 50% of the prize of the tickets back.
I am looking forward to your promt reply.

First you have written that the starring were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but the real actors were different. It was a disappointing for me, because this actors were recommended by my friend, because he knows Danny and Tina.
You have also written in your advertisement that it would started at half past seven but it started at 20:15! So we had to wait more than a half hour. It wouldn't be mind if the restaurant had to eat or drink something, but it was closed, and it hadn't opened after the show, because the waitress had to clean up the theatre room.

This short story is about a man who is accused of having murdered a rich elderly widow who inherited her whole fortune to him. He had befriended her without telling her that he was married.
The accused is defended by a famous lawyer who tells his wife that a loving wife's confirmation of her husband's alibi will not convince the jury
To help her husband she works out a plan: She is willing to be witness for the prosecution and states that her husband has not been with her at the time the crime was committed. She then gives letters to her husband's lawyer that seem to prove that she has been unfaithful to him and that she tries to get rid of him with the help of false accusations.

That was terrible but we didn't want to make a big deal of it so we went inside and waiting. The show started forty-five minutes later. We got really bored waiting.
After the show had finished we went for dinner at the theatre restaurant but it was closed because the owner was ill.
From all these reasons you can understand how unpleasant our evening. was We are asking you to return our money. Hope you'll understand

Dear Sir or Madam,
I'm writing to complain about the musical show 'Over the Rainbow ' I've visited it last evening in your 'Circle Theatre'. By the way I would enquire about some money back.
I read your advertisement for the show and I decided to have a wonderful evening by visiting it. I believed in the phrase by which the advertisement ended: 'Your perfect evening out!' But nothing was perfect.
The show should started at half past 7 pm but nothing happened. I waited and it becomes 8 o'clock pm - nothing happened. At quarter past 8 pm the show started and I was looking for Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. But I saw some foreign actors I didn't know. I was very it and I remember that this was the third problem this evening. By arriving at the theatre there were no discounts available. Now I asked myself if there will come another problem. The problem came. The restaurant, which I decided to visit after the show for eating something, was closed without any explaination and the perfect evening was completely unperfect.
I think this are reasons enough for enquiring about some money back.
I would be gladly to get an answer from you.
Faithfully,

Nowaday people wear lesser clothes. Often you causes very litte and short robes and tops. Often you show your skin because its popular and everyone do it. So it's possible to wear nothing in the future. A lot of thinks will be easier to do.

Dear Sir or Madam,
On 14th June 2000 I went to see your ""Over The Rainbow"" musical show and I have a few points which I would like to bring to your attention.
Your advertisement was featuring ""Danny Brook and Tina Truelove"" as the main characters but in fact some other people replaced them that evening.
The time mentioned on the tickets was 19:30 however the show started at 20:15.
As I came to London on holidays and purchased ""The London City Guide"" I saw your advertisement explaining that people could buy discounted tickets for £5 in advance. Well I tried to do so but the lady at the desk told me that they were quotas available at that price but were already sold out!
After the show we tried to go to your restaurant but unfortunately it was closed for renovation!
I was very disappointed of my supposed ""perfect evening out"" to your theatre and due to all the above-mentioned reasons I am asking for a complete refund on the two attached tickets.

""Technology"" is an appealing as well as an interesting word for me. From ancient times up to now this science has allowed the world and human-beings to develop positively and negatively.
Egyptians, Mayas, Incas, etc. were civilisations with great knowledge because they were mastering most of the science fields we deal with today.
Back in the 30's the different governments invented guns, battleships and all kinds of weapons for their armies. The military technology has affected our lives more than what we think because most of the equipments we use were originally created by those people.
The fast and growing computer industry is giving us less and less physical work. Biotechnology is providing us with the latested discoveries to heal or improve the human body to its most efficient state. Transport means are also part of the overall technology and allow us to go faster, further than before with less effort.
Besides all those improvements and confort I can't stop thinking where all this will lead us. I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives however I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or had already fallen in wicked hands.","['UD', 'UP', 'RV', 'TV', 'W', 'UP', 'UD', 'UA', 'CN', 'AGV', 'UJ', 'RV', 'R', 'DJ', 'MV', 'W', 'R', 'R', 'AGN', 'S', 'MP', 'MP', 'TV', 'RT']",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,2,0,1,0,2,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0

But are they are usefull in every situation and everywhere? My oppinion is that modern technology can help you to save time. In my case for example my car is very time-saving. If I want to go to training I need not wait for the bus, and so I need not start one and a half hour before training I start a half hour before. So I save one hour, which I can use for other hobbies or for homework or something else. The same with mobile phones, if I got one I needn't go to the public phones, I save time. If I got Internet I can send e-mails, I needn't go to the letter box, I save time. In my daily life I can save time, but I think every body should use his saved time for things like hiking, walking, swimming, for a ""natural life"" and not for a life in a technical world with stress and sorrows because we are humans and not robots.

Modern technology has changed my daily life in the point that all I do is becoming more comfortable. For example when I have to write a letter or do my homework, I always write it on the computer. If I search something like a telefonnumber or an adress I also look it up from the internet. I use also the internet when I need any informations for example I need them for school or private for myself. A few years ago I had to go in a library and look it up in many books. Most that took a long time.
I think the advantage of modern technology is that all I do goes very fast and I have more time for my hobbys or for friends.
Another important point for me is that things like listening music or watching TV sounds better and the pictures on TV are being impoved, because the machines become more better. And also a good for me is the Handy, because everywhere I go I can talk to other people.","['RN', 'RA', 'RJ', 'MT', 'S', 'S', 'RT', 'RP', 'W', 'RP', 'CN', 'MP', 'MC', 'R', 'DY', 'MP', 'RT', 'R', 'UA', 'RA', 'IN', 'MT', 'AGV', 'S', 'IJ', 'RN', 'DN']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,2,2,0,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Last night, I cam to your musical show, ""Over the rainbow"" and I was very disappointed because it wasn't what you writed in your advertisement. For example, your advertisement said that the starring were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but at the show they were not them! They were Kevin Starr and Jessica Richmond. For me, this a big mistake. This event was not the only one because another problem was the respect of the time. Your advertisement said that the show will start at 19:30 PM, but it has started at 20:15 PM. I don't like to. The third problem was that it was writting that the discounts were available, but when I get there it was not true. The fourth problem was that the theatre restaurant was supposed to be open after the show, but once again it was a lie because the restaurant was closed for renovation. After that, I can tell you that I spend the worst evening in all my life at your show and that one more time your advertisement lied about ""You will have a perfect evening!"" After all these explanations, I am sure that you will understand that I would like to have my money back and that I was disappointed last night. So I wish to hear soon about you.
Yours sincerly

Modern technology, such as computer, car and other else, changed my life in many different ways like communication, traveling and working. For example, a car, which is used from everyone everyday, changed my daily life in the sens that I don't need my dad or my mum to go to ice-skating or to go to work. I can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of the technology, but because I can show that I am responsable. With this car I can see the world, not exactly, but I can travel and visit other countries that Switzerland.
Another technology that changed my life is the computer because you can do many things with it like homeworks, works, photos, but the most important at my eyes is the communication with my friends from different parts of the world by the web. This a big walk in the technology and I can say that it is the most important for me because I like to have a lot of friends. So I spend almost one hour every day on the web. At last technology that I would like to bring out is the TV. This is a good one because you can see what is happening around you and everywhere else on Earth. Naturally technology is everywhere even in the kitchen, for example a special plate or else, and I could talk a lot about them, but I think that the one here are the most important in the change of my daily life.","['AGN', 'AGN', 'R', 'TV', 'R', 'IV', 'RT', 'RP', 'S', 'UT', 'UD', 'S', 'SX', 'MQ', 'MP', 'CN', 'CN', 'ID', 'UD', 'RT', 'MV', 'ID', 'UD', 'RY', 'M', 'RV', 'MA', 'MN', 'MC', 'AGV', 'UD', 'FV', 'UT', 'M']",0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,1,1,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

I am writing in order to complain about the show ""Over the Rainbow"", which was played in the ""Circle Theatre"", because the information which was given in your advertisement was not true at all.
First of all I would like to say something about the starring: I went to the theatre because I wanted to see Danny Brook, but once there I found an actor who I had never heard about. So the main point of my visit had dissappeared.
Another point is the time when it started, exactly 45 minutes later. A serious theatre can't miss such an important thing, the starting-time. I had to wait all that time in the street, because the hall was not big enough. Moreover, once I was going to pay for the tickets, I found another thing: there were no discounts avaible. In your advertisement you informed us about their false existence.
But there is still another point: the theatre restaurant where I had decided having supper was closed, without saying the reason. I had to go back to the hotel, because all restaurants in the area were absolutelly crowded.
Summing up, you might have noticed that that wasn't ""my perfect evening out"" wich you promised, so I would like you to give me the money I paid for the ticket back. This might be the only way I keep on relying on your theatre.
I hope I will receive an answer.

It was late in the night, and Pat was thinking about something Nick had told her that afternoon: - ""Don't tell Marie I was here"". Nick was Marie's boyfriend, and Marie a very good friend of hers. They were in the shopping centre, and the problem was that Nick wasn't alone, he was with a very beautiful girl. What could Pat do? That morning Marie had told her that Nick couldn't go to the cinema with her because he had a lot of work to do in the afternoon so.. what was he doing there with that girl?
In the end Pat phoned Marie and told her: she was a very good friend. Marie was so shocked that, as soon as Pat had stopped speaking, she phoned Nick and, without letting him say anything, she broke up their relation.
But the truth was very different, because what Nick was doing there was something which had nothing to be with what Pat had thought. Nick was there because the following Sunday would be a very special day for him: he would have been going out with Marie for three years, and he wanted to buy a present for her. But..what about the girl? She was his cousin! She works as a model, and she was advicing him about which clothes, etc,... buy for her.
Pat couldn't keep that secret, and in spite of helping Marie, she made a couple disappear.","['MP', 'MV', 'RN', 'RV', 'S', 'RQ', 'FV', 'RV']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One minute I told her the biggest secret of my life, the next she had told someone all about it. I trusted her! How could I have been so stupid, so blind not to see her disability to keep the biggest secret about my biggest crush ever?
When I overheard girls from other forms gossiping about me and my latest crush, I was furious. I was seething. From that day onwards, Pat and I stopped being friends.
I moved away that year, away to a whole new place and a whole new school. Once in a while my old schoolmates came and visited me and we had lots of fun together, just like the old times. However I felt I could not talk to them about the problems I was having, my parents getting a divorce.
When my parents told me the news, I was stunned, dazed. My dad began packing his things the very next day, to his new apartment where he would live while waiting for the divorce papers. That period of my life was one of the worst. I went into a depression, and not matter who tried to make me feel better, I only felt worse.
However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat. She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days. She told me she heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help. When she was comforting me I noticed she had changed. She was a person I could turn to, I could trust. She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do to anyone. Ever since, she gained my trust and told her my feelings and secrets. Unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul. She kept every single one of my secrets well, and not surprisingly, she became my best friend. Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager.
My happiness was short lived. When I came home from school one day, I received a phone call from Pat's mum, and in a voice chocked with tears she told me that Pat had died in an accident. She had been killed by a speeding car.
The news shook me to the very core. I cried for days straight, eating and sleeping very little. I fell into a deep depression, and took an extremely long time to recover.
I am still missing Pat, but my pain is nearly over now. I could only comfort myself by reminding myself that at least she died knowing I had forgiven her for telling my secret.","['RP', 'MT', 'RN', 'R', 'UY', 'MP', 'R', 'MV', 'R', 'SX', 'TV', 'RT', 'RV', 'MA', 'TV', 'MP', 'MP', 'S', 'RY', 'TV']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,0,1,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Second, the musical started forty-five minutes later! and, to make matters worse, the actor was not Danny Brook as the advertisement said. The new actor was not as good as Danny Brook, and he did not perform the show as he should have done.
Finally, I found that the theatre restaurant was closed because there had been problems with one of the ovens.

Dear Manager,
I'm writing this letter to express my disappointment with ""Over the rainbow"", the musical show which I watched last evening.
First of all, according to the advertisement, one of the main actors would be DANNY BROOK who I love. Instead of this, I had to watch the performance of a different and unknown actor who wasn't so great as I expected.
Secondly, the show started one hour late and I hate waiting in a queue more than it's necessary. I felt very upset and my enjoyable night became a stressed and very expensive one, too.
There wasn't discount avaiable for the tickets and I went to the theatre with my three cousins from Brazil. In addition to this, after the show, we looked for the theatre restaurant which has been closed for repairing since one month ago.
In conclusion, last night definitely was the worst experience about entertainment I've ever had in my life and that's why I ask you my money back as a compensation.

I'm writing to you, to complain about the musical show ""OVER THE RAINBOW"", that I came to see during my holiday in London, at your theatre. Unfortunately that evening wasn't as good as I expected.
First of all in your advertisment for the show you wrote that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were taking part at the show. And I was so excited about it! But I was very disappointed when I realised that another actor was taking part. And the worst was that he wasn't so good in his role!
Another thing was that the show I went to was starting at 19:30 but it started at 20:15! The people who were there to watch the show were very ungry and they were shouting because they were waiting for too long, And I absolutely agree with them. Also in the advertisment you wrote that discounts were available, but they weren't, And also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show, to eat some thing or to have a drink. But when I went there, it was closed. I don't know why and I'd like you to tell me, the reason.
Finally, you said that it would be our perfect evening out. Well it wasn't and I ask for my money back. I'd like you to return them to me.
I'll wait to hear from you soon...","['RP', 'UP', 'UP', 'W', 'MP', 'S', 'RT', 'UP', 'MN', 'MN', 'RD', 'MV', 'FV', 'S', 'MV', 'FV', 'UT', 'RP', 'TV', 'S', 'RP', 'UP', 'UP', 'TV', 'AGA', 'TV', 'UP']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

In my opinion, there are two possible fashions for the future. If humans turn to be more free from social rules, I think that their dressing will also be very extreme and unlimited. There will be a variety of colours and fashion styles. Everybody will wear anything he/she likes, choosing clothes from any century they wishe without this being strange. On the other hand, if human society turns to be stricher and more limited, there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing, formed by the needs of the society. All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule around. Perhaps the style of their dressing will indicate their position in society too.
This is how I think fashion of the future will be like. The most exciting about this is that people won't think that their clothes are strange as we don't think about ours.","['DY', 'RT', 'UT', 'RV', 'RN', 'S', 'RV', 'RV', 'S', 'UD', 'UY', 'RN', 'RY', 'MD', 'MN', 'MP', 'MY', 'UT', 'MV']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,0

I went there at 19.00 because the show started at 19.30 as the advertisement said but I queued for at least an hour because the ticket machine broke down. Finally, after an hour, when my term came to buy the entrance ticket, you staff said I couldn't have a discount and. However I bought the ticket even it was more expensive because I'd been queuing for ages and I really wanted to see my favourite idol, Danny Brook.

After the boring show finished, I was hungry and I decided to go to your theatre restaurant but the restaurant was closed after 19.00.

We tried to complain but the girl at the tickets desk was very unpolite. However, we decided to get into the show. Danny Brook is a good friend of mine and our purpose was to give him a surprise. You can imagine how were our faces like when we saw that it was not Danny, but Peter Fox, who was on the stage. Nevertheless we decided to stay there till the end of the show and to take dinner in your restaurant, where we were supposed to meet some friends; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out. I am sure that the restaurant closed at its closing-hour but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late. As you can read it was not our ""perfect evening out"" at all. I was really disappointed. I realize that managing a theatre is a hard work but I have to ask you the money of the tickets back. Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes on the advertisement, before the starting time of the show.

My composition is going to focus in two main ideas: how the modern technology has changed my home life and how it affects my personal and professional life.
Technology makes easier the work at home. I can't imagine how my life would be without a washing machine, a drier or a fridge. During the winter, when it is raining, you can have your clothes dry in less that thirty minutes. That's fantastic.
Technology has also been a great help in my everyday work. I am thinking mostly on computers. Being a journalist I have to write lots of pages every day. The computer allows me to change my ideas without any effort and to store a big amount of information in the minimum space.
Also, the e-mail system is really hepful. Thanks to the advance of Internet I can contact lots of colleagues all around the world everyday (and with the minimum cost). But, on my opinion, the best thing is that I can stay at home or going on holidays, and send my work to the office everyday.","['RY', 'UD', 'W', 'RN', 'SX', 'RT', 'RJ', 'S', 'RN', 'MD', 'RP', 'ID', 'FV', 'FN', 'RP']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Circle Theater
Dear Sir,
I am writing to complaint about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week's holiday in London.
My girlfriend and I read an advertisement about the show ""Over the Rainbow"" which is very popular. She is fond of the actor Danny Brook so I decided to buy two tickets, provided there were discounts available. When we asked for discounts tickets, we were said there never were discount offers and that we had to pay the highest tickets - £20 each - because we were not English students. We were annoyed about it but we paid off. We took our places, and began chatting with other people. We had to wait 8.15 pm before it started whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm! Moreover, we were astonished that another actor we did not know was playing the role of Danny Brook. My girlfriend was very upset and so was I.
After that we thought we could have a drink in your theatre restaurant but it was closed because the decorations were being changed. Finally we had the worst evening I have ever imagined, it was definitely not the ""perfect evening"" as written in the adverstiment.
So I want my money back for these two tickets - I have included a copy - and I hope you will pay more attention to the way you treat your customers, and avoid false advertisement.
Yours faithfully,","['SA', 'DV', 'RT', 'MP', 'IJ', 'RV', 'MT', 'RJ', 'RY', 'MY', 'MP', 'RN', 'AGV', 'S', 'M', 'RN']",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

How interesting it is to imagine what kind of clothes people will wear in about a hundred years from now. Fashion is changing so quickly that all our dreams about clothes can become true. But let's see my point of view. In a hundred years, clothes would certainly be totally differents than ours. Materials, textures and colours change, and are minds too.
So I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like bottles of aluminium. And I hope colours won't be dark and sad but very bright and enjoyable to see.
I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans. Syntethic materials have grown up and become very popular so it would keep going on. But maybe the shape of the clothes will changed: large pants as, or trousers with many pockets as we see today. For women, clothes change more than for men's. It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothes. I guess they will wear a sort of tunique upon a shirt and a skirt, or more male clothes because they want to change. Finally it's very difficult to say that.
Maybe Luc Besson's ""Fifth Element"" movie is quite a good example. The clothes were designed by the famous Jean-Paul Gaultier. And it really is an interesting point of view.
To conclude, in the end clothes won't be what we think about today, and it's a good thing because we can only imagine and follow the trend of fashion that makes us feel pretty and happy.","['MP', 'RV', 'MD', 'TV', 'IJ', 'R', 'R', 'W', 'UT', 'S', 'RV', 'AGA', 'UT', 'TV', 'W', 'UT', 'UP', 'R', 'S', 'RT', 'RJ', 'RA', 'M', 'W', 'R']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,3,0,0

I was pleased to hear from you last week. Now I am writing to you because a story of Agatha Christie is going to be read on the radio. Its title is ""Accident""
I know you are interested in the author and I think you'll like the story.
Firstly the main character is Evans, a retired police captain. He is not as well-known as Poirot or Miss Marple, but his personality it quite interesting. I am sure you'll agree with me.
Secondly the plot. It is about a woman who poisoned her first husband. At least this is Evans' opinion. Not only is the plot interesting but also it catchs your attention since the first moment.
Finally, you should pay attention to the ending which is surprising.
I hope you will spend a good evening listening to the radio. The story is going to be read next Friday at 8.00 p.m. Have a good time and write soon.

I've recently visited London for holidays and during my stay I went to your theatre to see the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"". I am really sorry to say that I am very disappointed about the whole organisation of the musical, starting from the advertisement. Firstly, in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be Danny Brook. An actor that I admire and I wanted to see him performing. Unfortunately instead of Brook I saw another actor, totally stranger to me. Secondly in the advertisement the starting time of the musical was said to be at 19:30, but the theatre started at 20:15. I don't want to be rude, but this is not proffessional at all. Another thing I would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets.
There wasn't any discount. Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at yor restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock. and the musical finished at 11:30. And I am asking you: Why do you adverstise it if is not going to be available for the audience?

We are living in the 21st century where everybody is surrounded by advanced technological methods. As a result of all these advanced technological methods, I became one of the daily users of modern technology. Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages.
The first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer. I spend most of my time in front of the computer, either working or playing. Of course this sometimes is an advantage, when for example the computer helps me to do my job easier, but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends. But unfortunately I cannot live without a computer. The first thing I do in the morning is start up my computer, check if I have any new e-mails, check my electronic calendar and then go to work, where I always work with a computer. The computer has become my second nature.
And not only the computer. Everyday I use the microwave for heating my food and of course. I always carry with me my mobile phone. One of the greatest technological achievements and I am afraid to say that I cannot live without my mobile phone.
In conclusion I would like to say that modern technology is offering to the humanity to many things, some of them are good and some others are not so good. It's up to us if we can use those technological achievements in the right way, and make our lives easier. The only thing I really is that if you know how to use technology is a benefit for you.

I went to buy the tickets but when I paid there was not any discount avaible. In the advertisement you told me I would have discounts.
This was not the worst thing because when I arrived at the theatre I was waiting fourty five minutes because the show should start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15. When it started the main actor Danny Brook was not in, another worse actor was taken his part. In my opinion when the main actor can not do the show it is better not do the show than do it with a horrible actor.
When it finished I arrived at the theatre restaurant but it was closed because they are going to do a new better restaurant.
In my opinion you should refuse my money because the evening and the show were so terrible.

DEAR SIR,
I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WHICH OCCURRED IN THE LAST MUSICAL SHOW OF THIS THEATRE.
FIRST OF ALL, DIFFERENTLY OF ADVERTISED, THE MAIN ACTOR WAS NOT DANNY BROOK, BUT OTHER UNKNOWN PERSON.
TO MAKE MATTER WORSE, THE SHOW DELAYED STARTING AT 20:15.
AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH, I DID NOT OBTAIN A DISCOUNT IN THE PRICE OF THE TICKET, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO YOUR LEAFLET.
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT OF THIS PLACE, BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED AFTER THE SHOW.
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED, BECAUSE THAT EVENING OUT WAS NOT PERFECT AS I HAD PLANNED.
SO, I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD REFUND OF ALL OR PART OF MY MONEY WHICH I PAID FOR THE SHOW.
I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING YOUR PROMPT REPLY.

Dear Sir,
I am writing this letter to show whom disappointed am I with the musical show ""Over The Rainbow"".
First of all I was expecting to see Danny Brook starring but I felt very disappointed when a different actor appeared.
When I saw the advertisement of the show it was written that the show will started at a half past seven but started at a quarter past eight.
Then when I was buying my ticket I asked for discount but they weren't available.
When the show finished I was eniting to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed.
I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disapointed experience I have ever passed. So because of this horrible evening I want to ask for my money back.

Dear MR SMITH,
My name is Volencia Vardez. I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering during the shows at your theatre.
Last May, I had a week holiday in London, and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW, the MUSICAL SHOW. I was really excited with the idea of seeing that show.
First of all, when I arrived, I met a note stuck on the front door that informed about changes at actor's staff. Danny Brook was ill. He was replaced by another actor whose abilities were bad.
Secondly, I want to tell you that the show started forty five minutes later.
In order to the tickets, I want to say that they are very expensive. I had put some money aside for a month, thinking about the discount, but when I want to buy them they said that discounts were not avaible.
To sum up, the restaurant was closed.
I will appreciate if you could send me my money back. Looking for your repley.
Yours Faithfully.","['RT', 'MP', 'UN', 'RT', 'RV', 'MA', 'RT', 'MD', 'DN', 'RJ', 'MP', 'FJ', 'R', 'RD', 'RV', 'S', 'RV', 'TV', 'MA', 'RV', 'S']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,3,4,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But things changed during her first mission. She was sended to New York to discover how some people from government gave money to the merchants because they want to build a Trade Center there.
At first she walked around the bayside market looking for all the people who were there. When she saw a man, different for the rest, talking with one of the sellers.

I am writing to you to complaint about five or six utterly outrageous facts. In the advertisement for the show, which I have picked up in the hall of the theatre, are there about five points which were not respected. To begin with, as far as the starring is concerned, Danny Brook should have performed the main character, and I saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not. Insofar as I came here especially to see him play, I have been very deceived, and this could be the understatement of the year, inasmuch as he is my favorite actor. Apart from it, the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! Could you explain me the reasons of such a huge late? Thirdly, the ad mentionned possible discounts. Personnaly speaking, I didn't saw it and even didn't heard of it: I have asked about it, but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts. On top of that, the restaurant was closed for renovations! How can you dare putting an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know that is closed? To put it in a nutshell, and quite honestly, I would like to emphasize on the fact that I did not spent a ""perfect evening out"" at all, as it is mentionned in the ad. For all these reasons, I would like, dear Sir or Madam, that you give me my money back. I am looking forward to hear from you.

Everything had begun when Paul went downstairs of the Heavy Sleep. As he closed his eyes, he started to travel across the dark paths of his councience. He went through valleys, plains and mountains of the Dream Landscape. He finally arrived in Faerie, a country of elder elves and strong white-bearded dwarves
While he was wandering in the depths of the forest he felt a little tired and sat on a grey huge stone, on top of which he could stare the whole woods.
All of a sudden, a weird creature popped into his dream. She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree. Paul was wandering wether this beast could be offensive when the creature said these words ""I am glad to meet you, Paul."" The boy could not beleive to what he was hearing. How did the beast knew his name? ""You see, I am a mere product of your mind, but I would like to go out of the Heavy Sleep. Please, bring me with you, in your reality!""
At these words, Paul suddently awoke. Relieved, he thought that bringing the creature in his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie, and with it, threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape, when he heard a creepy sound under his bed. He jumped out of his room, locked the door and found his brother, Pat. He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat it.
Unfortunately...one our after, a local zoo arrived and caught the creature in order to put her in a cage. There she died because of not having Faerian food necessary to her survival.

But I don't think he would want to.
He doen't want because he wants to prove the little and himself that he is not really old, even if he has a big age.
I think this are the reasons of his will. Although the fish is eaten by the sharks, he is the winner, the winner of himself. He could have triumph othe fish because of his knowledge of the sea but principally because he has in the deeper of his mind.

We asked our travel agent to organise our trip. My wife and I are both found of theatre, musical shows especially. It is so rare to see musical in Paris that we decided to book two seats for ""Over the rainbow"".
We were very disappointed! Of course, the show didn't start on time. No reasons or excuses were given. Our travel agent told us that it would be cheaper to purchase our tickets directly in the theatre. But, in fact, there were no discounts available. And we had to pay £20 each seat.
The worst was to come. The great Danny Brooks was supposed to be the main character. But, instead of him, we saw an unknown actor (who really need singing lessons).
After the show we had planned to go to the theatre restaurant. But it was closed. Perhaps it was a luck!

First of all, the most important singer, Danny Brook, was not singing. You should have at least informed the public because most of the people came to see him. However the man who took his place made a good performance, we enjoy listening to him because his voice was amazing.
The times were not respected: the show began 45 minutes late. The children could not stand waiting outside in the cold. As it started later, it finished later and people missed the train they wanted to take. Furthermore you did not apologise as if it was usual!
In my opinion, the tickets were a little bit expensive and not many people could afford the price. We did not see any discounts!
Finally your restaurant was closed because too few people came before. I understand them. After such a bad show you don't want to eat in the same place.
For these reasons I would like to have my money back because it was not a ""perfect evening"" as you said. But I think that if you take care more of the public, your show would catch on because the singers and songs are really impressive.

The ways of transport are improving a lot this times. The cars are really useful and a lot more faster than waking or cycling. But cars created pollution: for exemple the green house effect. But it is also the technology which try to resolve this problem with new way of transport as subways or busses so as to have less cars in the cities.
Technology allows us to improve our knowledge in sciences like medecine so as to cure more illnesses or to make people live older. I think there is a link between technology and sciences because they need each other: sciences discover technologies and technologies make possible new searches.
Technology also improved the communications with the phone of course and also with Internet. Every evening when I come back home I go on the internet. I chat with other people in order to exchange our points of view or I look for informations I need for my studies. In my opinion it's a lot better than the dictionnary because it's faster and you really find what you need. Furthermore we can find everything all the time.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And if he had been able to keep one, the following story wouldn't have happened.
Pat was a teacher for english as a foreign language. Sometimes he had liked to surprise his class with a test to see how good they would be when they could not have learned for it in advance. And always, every body made it surprisingly well.
What was the reason? Pat used to show the test to his friend Nick, when he had finished it to get his opinion. Nick now had taken a copy of the test to archive it. And the girlfriend of Nick happened to be in Pat's class. She was quite clever and had known everything about this, so she had taken copies for her classmates and everybody was prepared.

I am writing to complain about a musical show I went one week ago.
Firstly, I was really disappointed when I realised that the actor Danny Brook was not performing due to personal reasons, I like this actor very much and it was not the same without him. Moreover, the musical show was supposed to start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15 making all the spectators wait for nearly an hour.
To make matters worse, there were not ticket discounts as you advertised. Because of this I had to buy the cheapest and worst seat available. As if this were not enough once the show ended I had to walk twenty blocks to find a Restaurant since the theatre Restaurant was closed for mainteneance.
I, therefore, request an immediate refund of the £10 I spent on your musical show as I believe your theatre is directly to blame.
Looking forward to receiving your prompt reply.

Well, it's pretty simple to answer this.
Everything started when I was eight years old and my family bought a Personal Computer, I didn't paid attention to it at that moment but as soon as I grew older I started to like and play Computer games.
The years went by and after buying a newer, faster and better PC I found myself writing letters, doing School homework and evening learning with my Computer. In spite of my family telling me to turn the PC off and talk with them, I kept on stucked in front of the screen.
Nowadays it is a fact that my life wouldn't be the same without my PC. After I got connected to the Internet my life has completely changed. I spend my free time building my Personal Web Page with which I intend to earn money in the future; and I also check the weather forecast, buy food and pay bills through the web.

Firstly, the play started almost an hour late, and I went there to see Danny Brook, but there was a different actor on stage.
Secondly, in the advertisement the discounts are available but in the tickets I bought they were. Furthermore, I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work in were on holidays.

We also have five computer, the latest versions of them, because they are useful for my father to work and for me to do some special works for University. This machines are connected to Internet, and it gives to my family too much facility to get every information we want, from how to prepare son drink to what was the result of the Sunday's football match. In addition to this we use the net to comunicate with some friends we have in U.S.A. It's really amazing.

To the Circle Theatre's manager
Dear Mister,
I recently had the opportunity to see ""over the rainbow"" which was played last week in the Circle theatre.
I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed by the bad evening I spent there. Actually, I read the advertisment for the show and there were a few mistakes on it.
In fact, Danny Brook didn't play or appear on stage last Tuesday, the role was played by another - a quite bad - actor, less famous than Danny Brook.
I'm also sorry because I had to wait 45 mn before the pieces started. I can't accept waiting so long for the result I had. I was in London with some friends (we were students) and no discount was proposed or made for us. We had to pay £15 each for seeing a miserable pieces.
After the piece, we waned to eat at the theater restaurant but we couldn't. It was apparently closed and I'm asking you why.
As you can see, there are some ( volontary?) mistakes on the advertisment you made. We didn't have a ""perfect evening out"" at all. That's why I'm asking you for giving us money back.
I'm sure we'll find a compromise and I'm really looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am writing to complain about the musical show ""Over the Rainbow"" that has been presented in the Circle Theatre. As I was very anxious to see that show, I planned to go to the theatre in the last holiday, and I am completely disappointed with that.
First of all, I have to say that the advertisement was totally different of what I saw there. For example, the actors that were announced to take part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, the discounts were not available and the principal point: it started forty five minutes later. Then, to complete this terrible night, the restaurant was closed. I wonder you could explain me why.
Due to my huge dissatisfaction, I would like my money back, as you do not make what was advertised.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Nowadays, the Internet and the mobile phone with the developpment of satellite seem to take the lead. Do they affect my daily life?

Nevertheless, new technology has made me become more lazy. I spend a lot of free time watching TV, or surfing on the Internet or playing the computer. Maybe it change me into a kind of self-centered person, a loner.
But the positive way new technology have changed my life is in way to communicate.

Unfortunately, I had a terrible evening. At first I became worried because there wasn't any discounts available, like your advertisement say. And I became even more angry to have to wait 45 minutes for the show to begin. It's necessary to start on time, and your was informing that it would begin at 19:30. It didn't happen.
To complete my sadness, the main actor was replaced by another one who I've never heard anything from, and did not have the same talent that the one shown on the advertisement do.
I'm writing to you to complain about this show, and to ask for my money back. It isn't fair not returning the money for a person who bought tickets to watch a show that was supposed to be great, but actually was a shame.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And because of that, everyone at school happened to know that Ali was dating Nick, that used to be Caroline's boyfriend at the time.
Pat was Ali's best friend, and because of that, Ali told her that she was going out with Caroline's boyfriend, but asked her to keep the secret.
One week later, everyone at school started to laugh at Caroline and look down on Ali and Nick. Caroline discovered everything, and argued with the infidel couple. It was a big quarrel, people that were many meters distant could hear it. Pat entered the fight, and it became more loud and agressive.
One more week has passed, and things became calm: Ali decided to never look Pat on the fact anymore. They have turned themselves into big enemies. And Nick told her that his real love was his girlfriend Caroline, and that they weren't going to break up. Poor Ali..
So, it's very important to be a person than can keep secrets, even your own secrets, or a friend's one. One of the most beautiful things on the world is the true and loyal friendship.

As this evening was for my family and I a wasted one, I permit myself to ask you for refund.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

My name is Marcia Fomalar, I am writting to make you know how disappointed I felt when I went to the musical show of the London theatre.
I decided to see the 19:30 show so I arrived on time at 19:00 o'clock. I went to buy the ticket and as I like to enjoy the show near of the stage I bought a £20 tiket but when I asked for the discount they told me ""I am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement, It will be impossible to make you a discount"". This was my first problem.
At 19:15 I was very impatient waiting for the show begins and a man anounced that the show will start at 20:15. I had to wait more that an hour outside the theatre because to make matters worse I couldn't spend the time in the theatre restaurant. The reason they gave me it was closed because it was being repaired.
Finaly the show started and to my sorprise my favourite actor Danny Brooke had been replaced by another actor. Now what I hope is you refound me my money, it was a horrible evening out

I thought she could have a show in this special party so I talked to Pat, my best friend, if she could help me as she works in the production of T.V. programes. She loved the idea and said she had differents shows so to decide which could be the most suitable. I told her to make me a phone cold.

First of all, I would like to tell you that it was very disappointing for me that the starring was not Danny Brook as your company had published.
Moreover, the musical show was said to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:15.
As the show finished later, we decided to eat something at your theatre restaurant but to our surprise, it was closed.
As a result, we came back home in order to eat some fast food.
An other thing is that there was any discount available so we spend a lot of money in such a bad show.

Otherwise, I will sue your company.

We went to a place called 'Deli' where we talked a lot about our school, the exams and, as we usually did, about our friends and boy friends.
We asked each other a lot of questions but then we started talking about things that had never been talked about with anybody. Such as the most important thing that had happened to us in our life and that kind of secrets...
The problem started when I confesed her that I had fall in love with Larry, who was my cousin's boyfriend.

I am writing to complain about the musical show 'OVER THE RAINBOW' I attended three days ago.
I was very disappointed with the performance and apart from that there were many problems.
Firstly, the start time was at 19.30 p.m, but the play started at 20.15 p.m. People were fed up with waiting so long and most of them apart from me were rather nervous.
Secondly, the well-known star Danny Brook wasn't there, but a different actor I had never heard from him. From my point of view I think he was such a very bad actor that was impossible to fine another with the same features.
As far as the tickets is concerned no discounts were available, so, I found it expensive.
After the show I went to visit the restaurant as it is said it is very famous and apart from that I wanted to have a drink. At the end I had to go home as it was closed because the coffee pot did not work. What nonsense!

Secondly, the show was really late. It started at 20.15, not at 19.30 as it was supposed to be. And, although you have promised in your advertisement, there were no discounts available.
To make things worst, the restaurant was closed. The manager said it was closed because they had not been informed that there would be a show in that date.
To sum up, it was not a perfect evening out. And, I would appreciate if you give me a refund.
I look forward to hear from you.

In my opinion, the clothes will be more colourful, funny and confortable. I think that we will not use formal clothes anymore. People will prefer to use confortable clothes, even to go to the office.
The clothes will be more colourful and consequently more funny. We will not use black clothes as we are used to do. People will use yellow, pink and green clothes. This way, people tend to be happier.
However, the clothes will not be as teenagers use to wear nowadays to go to ""raves"". It will be more beautiful and clean.
Mainly, people will not be so fashionable as they are nowadays. They will wear a clothe only if they feel good wearing it.

In order to the times, the show was supposed to start at 19.30 and it started at 20.15, nobody likes to wait 45 minutes just watching empty scenary.
Another thing, the tickets. The advertisement said that there were discounts available, that was false, there were not any kind of discounts.
After all I just wanted to go to the restaurant of the theatre and have something to eat, but it was closed because the police had closed it. They had closed it because they had found the food in bad conditions.
Just to finish, the advertisement said that the show would be a perfect evening out, let me tell that it wasn't not. I paid a full ticket without discounts to wait 45 minutes, to see a musical show with a bad actor and after all could not have a sandwich because the restaurant was closed.

The most important development is the internet system which is connected to the whole world's computers by some telephone liens.

There are also much more advantages, you can buy somethings in a supermarket, you don't need to go out of your home.
Other than the internet system, there is also many modern technology which is changing our daily life. For example, we can go to the Mars and do some invesgation. So, we know much more about our universe. Some modern technology is also. For example, trains can go faster and aeroplanes can travel faster.

Firstly I would lice to say that I am very dissappointed with the show and that I didn't have the perfect evening out, as you had advertised.
I have no idea from. The main character of the musical show, which I'd like to say wasn't the ""BEST"", was awfull. His act was not good and he didn't seem like acting Even my son could act better. After the horrible act of your star, it comes the starting ours. I was sitting and waiting for forty five minutes until the play started. You advertise that the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20:15 as it did. And then, when I arrived at the theatre I expected to have a discount but unfortunatly I didn't. Among all these the theatre restaurant was closed, because the shef and the waiters where on holiday. You could hire other to do the work. I was very dissappointed what else can I write.

I couldn't accept it. All these years I believed that my father was killed in a car accitend. I was leaving in a lie.
Now in the age of seventeen I made the huge mistake to say, this problem to my ""friend"" Pat. I knew that she is close to my brother and that she loves him a lot, so I never thought that things could turn like this.
When, one day Pat came over to my house we started arguing about common things and in our fite suddenly came about. Pat started shouting and screaming, saying what was realy going on. My brother couldn't stay away. He stand outside my door and heard every single word. When I realised it, it was too late. The secret was revilied.

I am writing to express my great disappointment about the musical show I attended in your theatre last weekend.
According to your advertisement, it stars DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE, but surprisinggly, it was proformed by a different actor who I even didn't know the name. In addition, the show was supposed to be started at 19:30 but it was half hour later, until 20:15.
To make the matter worse, I had expected the ticket with some discount, but when I went to the ticket box, there was no any discount available. The last thing is the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, because it only opened until 9 o'clock at night.
You can imagine how disappointed I am when spending money on such a terrible evening. I would like you to look into the matter immediately and I insisted on some money back. I look forward to receiving a satisfactory reply as soon as possible.

Spending a week in London for holidays last week, I had decided to go to the theatre in order to see your wonderful musical show. Unfortunately, I had a really disappointed evening! Indeed, firstly, the play didn't start at 19:30 as it was planned on the advertisement but 45 minutes later (20:15).
Then, the actors (Danny Brook and Tina Truelove) who were mentioned and supposed to play weren't present. There were different actors who took the role.
Thus, the musical show wasn't as good as it should have been. I was very disappointed because D. Brook and T. Truelove are so great actors and I was very excited to see them.
Furthermore, on the advertisement I got, was written that the theatre restaurant was opened. I told myself, I could eat over there and maybe spend a better evening than at the begining but I wasn't lucky because the restaurant was closed! The customers weren't told why they couldn't have a meal. No reasons were indicated.

I am writing this letter to you in order to complain for the musical show ('Over the Rainbow') that was performed at your theatre last week; on Friday evening.
First of all, I should say that I had read fantastic reviews of it in several newspapers, specially regarding the starring actors' superb performances. These were in perfect agreement with my previous opinion about your company, which is said to be the best exhibitor of musical shows in Europe. With all these considerations in mind, I attended with the aim of having a perfect evening.
However,. In the beginning, it was impossible to obtain any of the offered discounts, even though I presented an official ISIC card. Then, the audience had to wait 45 minutes over the announced timetable for the show to get started. And finally, when it went on, we realised that there was not Danny Brook performing, which was really disappointing.
I hope you realise this was totally different from what you advertised, and I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future offering me some money back.

Electronic devices and 'gadgets' make our daily life more comfortable and easier, but does it means that we live better than ever? Of course, they have liberated us from a lot of tough routines, giving us the chance to have more free-time.
However, instead of enjoying this fantastic opportunity, people have become hooked on technological advances, feeding back their development in an accelerating, non-stopping race.
Machines do now most of hard work, but this does not mean that we are working less.

Sir, I returned very unhappy from my holidays. The reason is that the musical show that I had seen with my wife, first of all, started late. We bought tickets for the second show, that was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! We were interested on see the actors that appeard on the tickets and I was very disappointed when, in the show, we saw another actors. The tickets were more expensive than we had expected, but we didn't care because we saw in the tickets that will be discounts for it, but, they didn't make us discounts! With all this problems, the only thing that led us, was to eat something. When the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because people didn't arrived to work that day.

I'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday. I was very excited with the idea of going to the theatre, but it didn't work out as I thought it will.
First of all the starring actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, Tina did act, but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I don't recall.
Second of all, the play was suposed to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. I'm not used to waste my time sitting on a chair waiting, I do have better things to do with it.
Another thing I want to complain about, is that your advertised that discounts were available, but there wasn't any discount at all.

Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Now you've probably asking yourself what does it mean, well, now I'm going to explain it to you.
Two years ago in this school, Pat and I used to be best friends. We used to tell everything to each other. I was having some family problems, so my marks were getting down and down. Pat was worried, she didn't know what to do. One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp deep look, Never have I seen such a deep look: and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to. That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise. It consisted in stealing the school from the computer, in other words, hack the school software.
I thought it was a great idea, so I stole about ten tests we were planned to do.
Pat couldn't stand the pressure of the ""crime"" so she told the school directors that I stole the tests. I was punished, nearly expelt, but Pat didn't receive any punishment. I never accused her of lying, and I you ask me why, I really don't know.","['RV', 'RA', 'RV', 'MP', 'RP', 'RP', 'RN', 'FV', 'MT', 'RV', 'IV', 'R']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I heard somebody say ""Exciting books always describe people in difficult situations"". Well, I would not agree that this statement is always true, but it is true in the case of the book ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway.
The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular: an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea, fighting with a strong fish he had caught. What makes the situation difficult is that none of the two characters wants to give up. It becomes a fight about life or death.
The excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist. He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and the nature. So he bares everything: the days and nights on the sea, without any food or water, the terrible summer sun, the being injured from keeping to the line where the fish is on.
The reader feels with him, wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up.
Although this situation might not very difficult or important for anybody else, it is for this old man and I found it very exciting to follow this story until it's quiet, sad end.","['MP', 'TV', 'RQ', 'ID', 'UD', 'RV', 'UD', 'MN', 'RT', 'R', 'R', 'RT', 'MV', 'UP']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am going to write about what clothes will be worn in the future.
I have gone out to the street and I have asked to people for this question. I have all answers and I have made this article.
Most of people think that character people and clothes are together. They believe that people in the future will wear confortable clothes because they will be outgoing, amused, etc.
I really think that living in the future will be like living in the moon, very exciting. And people will wear cibernetic clothes but in the same time comfortable clothes. I believe that they will wear colourful jeans, T-shirts, mountain boots, etc. And all of this with a lot of colour. From my point of view, they will be more enjoyable than people now because they will have many things to do.
On the other hand, most of people in the future will wear glasses. It is because sunlight is very bad. At the end all people will be short-sight.

It is a point.","['RT', 'UT', 'UT', 'RV', 'MD', 'RV', 'UT', 'MP', 'FN', 'R', 'S', 'RJ', 'RT', 'RP', 'S', 'RT', 'R', 'MV', 'UT', 'RA', 'RT', 'R', 'DJ', 'FV', 'RV', 'W', 'RQ', 'W', 'RN']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,3,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,4,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0

Firstly, concerning stars and artists, they came from only six countries. For musics like jazz and rock it was excellent but for classical concerts we had a problem. Because some concert halls were too small. If you have any ideas about bigger halls, it will be better.
Secondly, about plays and films it will be good if you make more because the children like it. The dance shows was very wonderful like art exhibitions. Do not change about talks by writers, because it is a good idea if people can talk about their owns books.

The organiser,
I am writting to you to give your my opinion about your festival. It was great, but I think it could be even better next year.
First, it was an international festival, it was a great idea, but only six countries were here. So, if you can have more than six countries, it could be great. This idea is in relation with the number of plays and films. If there are more stars and artists from around the world, there are more plays and films and it is better.
My second complain is about some concert halls which are too small. It would be better if you have some large halls, like your ""Arena"" hall.
To conclude, I was very happy to have a ticket for all events at one reasonally price, because for someone who do not like especially art, it was very attractive.
A least suggestion for next year's festival is to invite some ""salsa"" band, It would be great to listen and dance in the same time ""salsa"" music.

In my home, the only things I am not allowed to do are things which can disturbe my familly. For example, put the music too hight when my syster is working. But there are also some life's rules, like do not put legs on the table when we are eating or eat with my fingers.

First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a greatful success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet. However, there are some points which can be improved for the next year.
To begin with, you wrote down in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance in fact their were only six countries involved. My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries.
Furthermore is that some concert halls were definitely to small or in other words to many people attended those concerts. This kind of problem you could avoid when you look for big halls at the begining.
Another point where you could improve is when you show more plays and films next year.
Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea with the weekend ticket was really good because it gave to the people the opportunity to attemp a whole weekend for a cheap price.

I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it. Anyway the people where asked this question probably found out that it isn't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes to much work.
A traditional way to earn money, in the spare time, is to bring newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village. The problems that you have here is the weather. For example when it is rainy, because then everything get wet.
Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help for changing the film rolls, for cleaning the toilets or to do some other small jobs.
But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something where you're good at, I mean if you're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people. Of course in the begining it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you're good at you'll also earn some money.

Here in Brazil the rules at school depends on the school. In general, the rules at private schools are much harder than the ones at state schools. In mine, we didn't have many rules. For example, nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom. We were allowed to go out if we didn't want to stay in class. But we had to use the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams.
the rules at home are very different. I am allowed to do what I want as long as I studie enough to. I think that my parents let me do what I want, because they trust me. they know that if I go out with the car, I will not drink. It is not allways easy, but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them.

As well, I want you to know my opinion and I'd like to give you my suggestions, because it would be useful to you for the next festival.
Firstly, I want to congratulate you for the idea, I think that it's and that everybody could assist without paying too much. Having a ticket for all the events is a great method because it's way of paying and you win time.
On the other hand, I must tell you that some concert halls are too small, so you can't be enough confortable to apreciate the event. Other thing, is that the artists come only from six countries, so don't cheat the people by saying that they are from all the world.
In my opinion, you should call more artist from other countries and have some concert halls bigger or may be change the distribution.
Well, I think that everything is told but could you tell me, if it's possible, if there will be more plays and films next year?
I'm waiting for your answer.

Thanks for your letter, it was nice to hear from you again. I've recently started the classes so all the rules were given to us, like you know, the first day. As you want me to tell you how about the rules are here, I'll start.
Firstly, in our classroom you can't shout, you must be quite and sat. You must pay attention always because you don't know if the teacher will ask you some question. In exams, you can't talk to the teacher, either you mustn't eat chuingham or take a walkman with you. In my home I can avoid that rules. My mum only doesn't want me to arrive late. However, I can go dancing whenever I want but telling her previously. My mum is a lovely woman and she doesn't know how much I love her because most of the day I'm outside, but that's the true. My father is a bit jealous but agrees with what my mum says.
So, I'm free when I'm out of the school..

Dear Mrs Clark,
I am writing to you about the International Arts Festival which took place these 21 and 22 November. I think it is a great idea to have this kind of festival in our region and I really enjoyed most of the events I went to. However, I feel that it could be even better next year.
Firstly, according to your advertisement, the 'Stars and artists from around the world' came from only six countries. I felt quite disappointed as everybody knows that ""our"" world is full of different cultures. Maybe not enough were represented.
In spite of the fact that the classical concerts were really good, I think that some concert halls were too small and so not everybody could appreciate the good quality of the music.
I really enjoyed the plays and films, I wonder if there would be more next year? I hope so!
Finally, I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably-priced ticket for the weekend is excellent, we can go where we want to, see what we feel like to. However, I think a weekend is really too short. May I suggest you to think about doing the festival over one week.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks very much for your letter. As you asked me in it, here are some school and home rules in my country, France.
First of all, and I think it's a big difference with England, children don't wear uniforms at school. I was very surprised when I saw them in your country. It was a bit funny for me.
Of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself, be polite with the teacher and the other school children. During the break too, usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you. I think nowadays, children are more free and, I mean the contact between them and adults. Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them ( not always) but also speaks with them.
At home is different, each family has its own rules. As I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired. But I was a wise child, so! Usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident. There are some rules like ""don't speak with a full mouth""; ""don't put your finger in your noise ""; ""say please and thank you""; ""don't fight with your brother""; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere.
Well, I hope I've helped you a little and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

The idea that I prefered the most was to suggest a reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events because a lot of student or unemployed people could not afford to pay too much money.
I went to see a classical concert and, although the music played was excellent, he concert hall was too small. Furthermore, I had expected stars and artists from around the world, but they came from only six countries.
A friend of mine went to see the play ""Hamlet"" and the film ""Gladiators"". He told me how great it was and I was thinking that it would be a good to have more plays and films next year. In addition to this, I was wondering if you could organize the same festival in sommer.

I'm very glad to hear from you. I hope everything is ok. I'm really sorry I didn't write you back immediately, because I was preparing my exam at that moment, so can you forgive me? We should keep in touch with each other, because you know I'm very happy to have a friend like you.
In your last letter you asked me something about our rules, both at home and at school in my country. I'd like to tell you that. In school, we have lots of rules, especially in the class and some of them are quite strange. For example, we can't go to the toliet during the lessons, we should go there in the brake. And we can't eat food or do any sports in our classroom. If you fail three subjects in your exam, you will be kicked out of school. It's too strickt, I don't like it. If I can, I would like to change this, because I don't think everyone can success at once, we should give them second chance to try.
Anyway, in my country, generally, children are free at home, but it also depends on their parents. For me, I don't have rules at home, just don't take trouble to my family, that's all.

The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Fesival I attended last weekend.
I believe that the event was good, however I feel that the festival can be improved next year.
Firstly I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it was said that I would find stars and artists from arround the world, when, in fact, they were from only six countries. I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to go to the festival, but it would be nice if next year we could meet other personalities.
Secondly I belive you should know that a lot of people, including me, were not able to enjoy concerts because some concert halls were too small.
I would be very thankful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year.
Last but not least I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separatelly.
I hope you find my opinion useful.
Once again congratulations on the Festival.
I hope to hearing from you soon

When the holidays began everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do, but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem to most of us.
there are several ways to earn a bit of money in your spare time. One of the most common examples is baby- sitting taking care of little children is easy and it doesn't require special skills, all you need is a lot of patience.
If looking after children doesn't fit you, you can try with pets. Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk. So if you like animals this is your chance to earn money and have fun at the same time.
Another option is to wash your neighbour's car. In this case you need to buy the materials you will work with, but don't worry, soap is not very expensive.
the most important thing is that you wisely choose the most suitable work for you, according to the things you like to do.
If you don't find anything good enough for you don't worry, you should always remember: It's not all about the money!","['RP', 'MT', 'FV', 'TV', 'RT', 'RP', 'UP', 'MP', 'RP', 'RV', 'M', 'MQ', 'RP', 'W']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

I have spent and I am writing in order to give my opinions about it.
When I knew it was going to be an international festival, I got really excited because I would finally have the opportunity to meet stars and artists from around the world, but I felt rather disappointed when I found out that was not at all true. Besides this, I think that some of the concert halls were too small that I felt very uncomfortable. However, the one-reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events was marvellous because I was able to attend as many concerts as I wished without spending much money.
Although that Festival was not well-organized, I would like you to repeat it next year. I wish you could perform more plays and films, and there should be more varied art exhibitions. But I really appreciate it if you would take into consideration the problem with the lack of space in the concert halls.
I hope you consider these pieces of suggestions.

Personally, I can not imagine human life without rules, especially those that have to do with respecting other people. Moreover, I am in favour of rules at school because it is very important for children to learn how to cooperate with others.
As far as I can remember, I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important concerning wearing the suitable clothes, to arrive in time and get on with every teacher and authority. As a consequence, most mates used to complain about those rules but all of us tried to put up with them.
At home it is the other way about. Fortunately, rules are made by every member of the family so that no one complains about them. I must admit that I am able to do whatever I want, such as inviting friends, watching TV until midnight and so on. In fact, the only strong rule is to cooperate with house-keeping and meal. That is all!

I would like to make some appoitments about the event that I had been.
First of all, the concert hall is too small to have a great concert. I think should be bigger for jazz, rock or still classical concerts.
Secondly, I had some ideas for the next year events, such as:
- Funny plays and films to the break time;
- Dance shows after dinner to have something interesting to do in the night,
- Art exbitions to know more things about artist's lifestyle; and
- talks by writers to say how good is his latest book.
In addictions, the ticket's is too expensive and difficult to buy another one every day, so, I think is more effective if was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events.

Firstly, I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events. But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries, not stars from around the world as you announce in your advertisement.

Thirdly, all the plays and films showed were interesting, In my opinion you should include some more films and plays in your festival next year.

How boring! At home everything is quite good, mum and dad are great but there's one main rule I must tell them were I go and what time I'll come back. Granny is the problem she's a bit bossy!

Dear Mr Clark,
I have seen your advertisement in ""the Sun"" newspaper on 10th November, and I went to the festival on last Friday. Most of the events were wonderful and well-organised. I enjoyed it, but I think it could be even better next year, so I would like to give my views of it.
Firstly, the idea of holding this International Arts Festival is great. I made people enjoyed their weekend, relaxed themselves, also it brought the foreign culture to them, enlarged their kownlegth. In addition to it, one weekend ticket for all events was only £10, this was excellent, it made people only spend, and then they could watch all the events at the weeked, for them it is really economical to spent their weekend. So my friends told me that was his cheapest weekend.
Moreover, the stars and artists were only from six countries, In my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more intesting, and from my point of view, some concert halls were too small, the people in there couldn't even go to the loo! because it was too crowed. Finally, the plays and films were wonderfully, as far as I'm concerned. If you can show more play and films It will achieve a good effect.
This are only my inmature views, if, I will be very pleased, thank you very much.
I'm look forward to hearing your replies.

Dear Yasmin,
It was really pleased to receive your letter yesterday, you asked me about rules; both at my home and at my school, I am very happy to tell you about this.
At my school, we aren't allowed to smoke inside the building, because the building is made of wood, it tend to catch fire easily, and we aren't allowed to use Internet, there are only ten computers in the school, only teachers can use it, if we used, we would be sent to the head office of the school.
At my home, there are many rules, because I'm careless, so I amn't allowed to smoke at home as well: and I'm not allowed to use telephone, because last year I made £1000 bill for one month, my parents were very angry with it, so they told me I am not to use telephone any more, oh, How!

Firstly, at school, we missed a course, we must bring a medical attestation.
Furthermore, when we failed an exam in June, we can have it in September. And if we are interested, we can spend six months abroad but we must pass the FCE.
At home, we must wash our hands before the lunch. And we mustn't speak during the lunch. I think it's not a good thing because we can't discuss with our family. There are so many rules but it would be too long if I had to explain all of them.

When I found the advertisement of International Arts Festival, I was very excited. It is to hold an annual international arts festival in the place. Then I spent two days at the festival. I enjoyed it very much. There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world. Jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance show etc. The thing is worth to remind here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourist could what they like.
Although how I enjoyed it, there were still something needed to be improved. For example, there were some conert halls which was too small to hold so much people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for audience. In the addition when you organize the next year's international arts festival, could you arrange more plays and films.

You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter. This remind me of what I experienced during my teeenage. In my country the children go to the secondary school when they are at the first year of teenage. Your know, this age is the trouble age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone. These always annoy the school teacher and parents. In a result of these the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak each other in the class. They had to finish homework in a limited time. They cannot to the teacher, girls are not allowed to make up and wear any accessories. At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me much amsh homework to do, even in the holiday. They also forbidden me to make a boyfriend. I think it is not just what happened in my home many of my friend had the same experience.
Now I'm a mother of two children. They are all in the school. Comparing to my experience, I want to give them more open attitude about everything. I want to be a mother of them and a friend of them. But at school, although I hope the teacher don't give students so much homework, don't forbidden the of the students, there are nothing I can do because of our culture. It's quite sad.
I'm looking forward to receiving your next letter soon.

I had recently spent two days at your annual international arts festival. It was the first time I went and I was very pleased to go. I, actually, wasn't disappointed. However I would like to give my opinion about the festival.
First of all, I congratulate you on making this kind of event. It was such a good success that some people weren't able to have tickets! You should increase the number of places you give., you could invite artists from around the world not only from six countries: it would be more pleasant.
Although I am keen on classical music, I found some concerts halled too small. I was wondering if you could improve that? Also, there were interesting films but not enough. Perhaps, you could possibly some producers, who come from others countries in order to show different cultures.
, to pay one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we could see all that we wanted without paying each time.
Finally I suggest to invite important scientists like Hubert Reeves or Aaroun Tazief so as to inform the public about the new technologies or sciences because it also a kind of art!
I look forward to seeing the next festival!
Yours sincerely,","['TV', 'TV', 'W', 'RV', 'RJ', 'RV', 'RV', 'RY', 'MC', 'FN', 'S', 'MQ', 'UP', 'RV', 'UP', 'IQ', 'RY', 'RV', 'MP', 'FV', 'UD', 'AGA', 'MV', 'RV']",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,2,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Thank you for your recent letter. I couldn't write sooner because I was very busy last week.
I see you are interested in hearing about school rules in France and also about what I am allowed or not to do at home.
To begin with the wchool rules we have in fact some important ones. Firstly, when you arrive late at your lesson, you have to apologize you to your teacher. Also when you have forgotten to do your homeworks. What's more, you had better have done them if you would have to go to the blackboard!
Although our library is very large, we mustn't make noise in order not to disturb the students, who work. It may be like that in your library, may not it?
I consider the school rules are good: we should respect the teachers and people who need to work.
At home, I have to look after my two little brothers when my parent's are here. If I don't make the cooking, I will have to do the washing up. I am sometimes allowed to watch the television when I have finished my homeworks.
Fortunately I can play violin when I want even if I haven't done my homework. It is what I like most.
I don't really want to change that, I think it is just like this. I hope this answer satisfies you.
I look forward to receiving your next letter!

Dear Jane Clark,
I went to the International Arts Festival and saw some interesting things, but many points could be better. That is why I write to you, to give you some suggestions that you can take into consideration or not.
Firstly, it is a good idea that the Festival is International. But in the advertisement it was written that the artists were from all the world and I saw only six nationalities.
Secondly, the classical concerts were excellent and the halls were so crowded that nobody could walk. In my opinion, it would be important to rent bigger halls next year.
Thirdly, I noticed that the plays and the films were a good entertainment. It attracted a lot of people and they were really after that.
Finally, the reasonably price of the tickets for the weekend was a good point, because all kind of people an afford to buy it. I also think that you should put a Snack-Bar or a little restaurant so as the people are not too hangry and morever you can realise big benefits
In conclusion, in the whole the Festival was a success, but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve.
I hope you will not take this letter as a complaint and I look forward to going to the next festival.
Yours sincerely","['RP', 'TV', 'RP', 'RV', 'MT', 'RC', 'RC', 'UD', 'AGA', 'L', 'DJ', 'AGN', 'S', 'AGA', 'RV', 'RP', 'RC', 'S', 'S', 'R', 'MP', 'RT', 'MA']",0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,1,2,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Andrew,
I receive your letter and thank you for it. I am very happy to hearing from you and I hope that you are fit., I want to talk at first about my school and then about my home.
As you know, I finished school two years ago. This year, I started a private school in Dijon. So the rules are clear, you need to participate to the lessons and also be successful at the exam of June 2000. In our class, we don't have problem with students who dislike to work, because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to say there years and years. It is also expensive and I can't afford to stay there too long.
In my home, my parents let me do what I want, because I am an adult now. But when we are in society, we have to be careful not to disturb the other persons. It is the same in our family and example my parents dislike hearing music in the whole house. When I go out, they don't give me an hour to be at home, because I don't exagerate.
In conclusion, I don't want to change something in my house or at school, because I totaly agree with the few rules that I have.
I hope these few information can help you and I look forward to hearing from you

I went to your annual international arts festival. I really enjoyed it, although I feel it could have been better. But firstly I want to congratulate you for organizing such a huge festival, people need this kind of events. Secondly I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it. As it was written in your advertisement, artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented, I was quite disappointed. However the concerts were great, but unfortunately, some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as a micro-wave inside.
Plays and Films were good and I liked them, but there were only a few, I hope there will be many more next year.
One of the most positive aspect of your festival is the price of your weekend ticket. As a student, the low priced ticket certainly athacted me a lot and gave me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists.
Finally, I would like to make one suggestion: you should find a place for a camping so that people who come from a long way don't have to spend money on accomodation. Anyway, I'm looking forward to coming to your festival next year.

Young people always need money, specially students who don't earn their life. They need money to pay their studies or for going out, but how to find a job which is good and not under-paid?
One of the best is working in a big supermarket. Some can find it boring but it is well-paid and not too tiring. Furthermore departement stores are always looking for students who would like to work.
Another solution could be working as a barman, the problem is that you go to bed very late, but it's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night. Unfortunately it's not possible unless you can rest in the morning.
If you are a really good student in one subject, you can provide private lessons which is one of the most job but do it only if you like teaching. Otherwise you should try to find another job.
The main thing to remember is that there many possibilities but you have to try to find them and not just say: ""I want to work and earn money"".","['RY', 'RN', 'MT', 'UP', 'MP', 'S', 'MP', 'MP', 'RJ', 'AGN', 'MP', 'MV']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
