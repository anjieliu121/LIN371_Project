That has to be the worst. Seeing or imagining a woman in the cloths she chooses can at least help when being bored, but shoes are just shoes. Shopping for them is a very long and tiring experiance.

In addition, it's so tiring to walk around the place over and over to find the thing you want. Apart from that, it's quite annoying when you have to compare or to the price in order to buy the cheapest one, if possible. Once you've got all your shopping list, you also have to carry all the bags that you just bought which is very heavy sometime.\nHowever shopping is not a bad thing, only if you plan it carefully what to buy, where to go, how much money you will spend on?", "['RY', 'MP', 'RP', 'MP', 'MV', 'MP', 'RP', 'MD', 'MP', 'FN', 'TV', 'MP', 'RP', 'DV', 'RA', 'MT', 'MP', 'AGV', 'RY', 'MP', 'UP', 'UY', 'UA', 'UT']", "{'filename': '0100_2000_6/doc521.xml'}"]}

There are new products which you could not imagine that could be so interesting. Shopping is a good way to kill your time and some times you can not realize how fast the time goes. This happens because people enjoy themselves a lot.\nOn the other hand there are some disadvantages. for example if you are a working mother with three children, that means you are always n a hurry, going shopping is really unenjoyable. You go shopping in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue.\nYou need to buy essential items like food and you get tired because it very crowded and you spend more time thank you prefer to.\nIn Conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too buzy.

My price was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at the concert. The pop group which was going to act is called \"Metallica\" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to.) But now to the concert itself. It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg. I started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am. First I had to help with the catering which lasted until 2 pm. After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that I also was not able to eat anything. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guiding tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I recognised that they are very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and I have to tell you, they did a great performance. When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like Did you like the performance! or How do you think about the first group? Questions like you and I usually ask each other. You know what I mean, they were not conceited or something like this. They were like any other person and I have to admit that I like them very much.

It's always a great job to go home with bags of purchases, but is it doing us good apart from the temporary satisfaction?\nEveryone likes sale, but those so-called sale items are not really of value. In fashion industry, sale begins at the end of each season and just lasts a short time, because those owners want to make room for new stock. But you'll find your 'cool bargain' soon get out of date and you have to keep buying new ones. Also supermarket owners have put in a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit. Therefore, we become impulsive buyers easily under these tricks. The result, we feel guilty after spending more than we've estimated, or even suffer from financial difficulty.\nShopping does not just effect us mentally, but also physically. It's not hard to realise how exhausted we are after a day of shopping. Think of the awful crowds, the busy car parks, polluted air in the city centres and mile-long queues in front of the cash desks.

Well, I took my chance and I was chosen to help at Michael Jackson's concert. Amazing, isn't it? The event took place a month ago in the Rock Stadium. There was about 100 000 people. We had a lot of things to do. Acctually, they put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the real hell. Many people fainted and some of them, the most serious cases, had to be taken to hospital. The biggest problem was connected with some foreigners who couldn't speak Polish or English and we didn't know how to help them. Despite this fact, the atmosphere was terrific.\nAfter the concert many people lost their way home, mostly foreigners who didn't know the buses' schedule.

This is based on a questionnair conducted in the school and our English department's investigation.\nLessons\nAccording to statistics based on the questionnair, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class. This may be thanks to native speaker teachers who came to the school last year. In fact, I visited some Englishe classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers. Furthermore less numbers of students were nodding off comparing with other classes like Maths. Consequently it might be a good idea to film the English class so that the vibrant and active atomosphere may be able to be filmed. This may also contribute to the promotion of English department.\nExtra activities\nIt was found that hockey is the most popular sport among students. As the record says, our hockey team has been on the top of the league for three successive years. The girls' football team is also famous for its reputation of keeness on practice. Although every school has a boys' football team, our school is the only one which possesses a girls' team. Team members can be interviewed.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, our school is famous for achievements in several fields as well as academic achievements. The whole point of making a video is to tell people that we are not only bugs of books but also enjoying our school life.

But situations in which you do not need to move carefully in order to avoid stepping on someone's feet are quite rare and, when they do happen, time passes by very fast. However, if you are another fool standing amidst the crowd, waiting for the queue to move, time slowly melts.\nBelieve me, shopping can also be painful. Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects. Amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesireble pains.\nNonetheless, people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at stake. They keep claiming that there's no such thing as shopping. In spite of our decadence, some cheap souls still have the courage to say that, by shopping, they're filling their empty spaces.", "['RN', 'S', 'RN', 'ID']", "{'filename': '0100_2000_6/doc1547.xml'}"]}

I really wish you were with me last month. Quess what I've done! I've been helping at a pop concert that happened at my school. That's why I have no time and wanted you to be there with me. I will tell you all about it!\nAs you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I like it and get quite good marks for my project, about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether I can be able and willing to help for the concert in two weeks time in the concert hall. I immediately say \"yes\" and also my friend. I really think it sounds so interesting. I have never done light and sound for the real pop concert before and I think it will be a good experience for me. Actually I've just done light and sound in drama's day in my school at the end of last term. But this time it'll be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television.\nThe preperation days came. The first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came. Their jobs are preparing concert. I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amuzing! It sounded very interesting to me. Then we started to talk about what we have to do for this concert. I have learnt lots of things about preparing stage, light, sound, background. I felt like I'm one of those professional too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of thing from doing the practical work. All of them were very nice and friendly. Another exciting part was, I had to climb to put the lights up. Can you imagine the real concert, and how high the lights always like? It was good fun though!, but my friend didn't like doing that at all. She didn't seem to enjoyed it as much as I do.\n, my ambition is to be like one of the professionals. I really do hope I can be like them. My teacher was very proud of me because after the concert, all the staff were saying how helpful I was and so on. Do you know, my ambition make me to try to work very hard and this term I get A for my art and design. It encouraged me so much and I think I can be good at it, if I keep on working hard. I think the concert has changed me so much, now I have my aim about what I should do in my life. I feel like I have to work harder.\nI hope you will feel like me one day.

Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have got a prior plan to teach the Korean children in Brighton about Korean and Korean history in the early August. Secondly, I would like to stay at log cabins which would have a good smell of nature in them. Also if I have to choose two of the activities, I would like to play tennis and to go surfing because playing tennis is my first choice and I am very good at it. And also the reason why I would like to go surfing is that I am always dreaming of surfing on the coast of California like on TV, but I have never tried to surf yet, which doen't mean I am bad at swimming.

In some peoples' opinion, shopping and spending money is a kind of fun and they can even get self-satisfaction from it.\nHowever, more and more people are now asking, \"Is shopping always so enjoyable?\" In my view, the answer is, NO.\nFirstly, since more and more people go shopping, shops are always so crowded, especially the popular ones. Try to imagine the scence: twenty or thirty or even more people are keeping a quel outside the fitting room. Would you say that shopping is enjoyable? Would you be patient enough to wait for half an hour or more just because you wanna buy a T-shirt?\nSecondly, the cost is also a problem. It will be really an annoying thing when you are keen on something but you can't afford it. One of my friend, Emma, happened to see a fantastic jacket which costs \u00a3105.

Who has never had a bad experience related with an unsatisfactory product? Moreover, who has the freedom to buy with? And finally who has all the time needed to do so?\nThere are many things that can go wrong in the process of adquiring a product or service. And whenever money is involved, some problems are likely to happen. Thieves will try to put their hands in our wallets and purses, and even the so called 'plastic money' is not always safe.\nHunting on the High Street, or the Shopping Malls, for the desired bargain - because we cant afford otherwise to buy - becomes often a desperate atempt to reach a living promoted by the new consuming society.

On the other hand, some people complain that there are a lot of artificial products, which are quite unhealthy, but very expensive.\nThe second thing I like about shopping is the possibility to find your own style buying clothes in the small boutiques. You can always ask for good advice from the experienced shop attendants, which does not necessarily cost you extra money. However, someone else may say, it takes too much time.\nThe third reason I enjoy shopping is that I never go alone just to buy a thing I need. I always take my friend with me so we can chat or have coffee in the shop's cafe.

When we arrived she persuaded me to go the backstage because her boyfriend was the electrician of the band. It didn't sound very exciting to me but I accepted above all because I was curious. Unfortunately what I found wasn't what I expected. Everyone was upset, worried or angry and Lucre, Ake's boyfriend, explained that it was because their pianist had broken his arm and couldn't play. In that moment Ake exlaimed that I could play the piano. After that I tried to tell them I had just begun but within five minutes I was on the stage and I was playing that, luckily, easy tune.\nI think you can't believe in what I've told you but I won't forget this experience.

When she finished the tests, I went to meet her, I told her I was very happy for staying there and having helped at the concert, and I asked her an authograph.

Is a kind of relief for them.\nOf course it is good to buy things for ourselves, like clothes, jewelery, anything. Specially if we don't have to worry about money. It's good to walk around looking all the news in the stores.\nBut, sometimes, go shopping can have other effects on you. It can stress you. For example, when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around. When you can't find what you are looking for anywhere. When you buy something you were looking for a long time and, when you arrive at home, you discover some deffect on it and have to go back to the store to complain. It is just terrible when the sellers don't treat us well sometimes we just give up and never come back to that store. And, a really bad thing is, after buying everything you wanted and feeling very happy with all that, you realize that you spent more money than you should...\nSo, after all this, I suggest that before you decide to go shopping to feel better you should think of all the problems you may have while you are shopping or the big headache you can have after it.

{"content": "Polish", "answer": "16-20", "metadata": "34.0", "null": ["3", "5.2", ",,Shopping is not always enjoyable\". From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not. It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money on our bank account. Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable. Luckily, I'm one of these people. First of all, shopping is a waste of time. People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy. During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area. I just can't understand people who with smile on their faces spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things. They are ready to sacrifise all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jelous.\nSo, as a conlusion, I might say that shopping isn't enjoyable at all and I'd rather stay at home instead.", "['RT', 'MP', 'MD', 'MP', 'S', 'SA', 'S', 'S']", "{'filename': '0100_2000_6/doc2348.xml'}"]}

It is my favourite sport. I am good and fast at swimming. Another sport I love is basket ball. Hopefull I will meet some other girls in the same sport. So we all play as a team.\nMy final question is this. Can you let me know if there is any facilities for washing my clothes If not I will bring with me enough to last for two weeks. Please give me a rough idea how much spending money I will need.\nPlease write soon\nYours Sincerely", "['MP', 'RA', 'RP', 'MD', 'UP', 'M', 'AS', 'TV', 'FV', 'MN', 'S', 'MD', 'AGN', 'TV', 'MD', 'AGN', 'MT', 'RP', 'M', 'MT', 'TV', 'R', 'W', 'RP', 'DY', 'MJ', 'TV', 'AGV', 'MP']", "{'filename': '0100_2000_6/doc2363.xml'}"]}

The main characters of this book are Stephen Biko, a black leader, and Donald Woods who is a white newspaper editor. Woods is thought to stand for all of white peope and this book could have an influence on them.\nIn the first part of this book it can be seen Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude to them. In some ways, he did not agree with \"Black Consciousness\" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites. Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live. The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him. Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist, in other words, he became an activist for the black people of South Africa.\nAlthough Biko was killed and Woods himself was declared a banned person, I would dare to say their sacrifices were worthwhile because Woods succeeded in escaping from South Africa which would enable him to publish his book revealing the truth about South Africa to the world.\nIn short, Cry Freedom deserves to be recommended and once you read it, you will want to read it again.

However, it was not bad, my mom always told me that I hadn't have earned enough money so that I shouldn't have spent it in the wrong way.\nTherefore, people who is over 18 can think of more reasons than young children for shopping and buying such tempting objects.

Very often you don't know what to buy because we don't have only three or four different sport shoes to choose from, not, we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike, adidas or Fila.\nAnd very often you have to pay a lot of money for the product you want.\nAnother cause is that shops and stores are often overcrowded.

That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where noone has time for you to show you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for me, no one to talk to and noone to complaine.

On the other hand, to show less pleasing aspects, it would be adequate to film Mrs. Morrison's French classes, as they are extremely boring and sub-standard.\nInteresting activities\nOne event that should not be missed to film, is the weekly football game between teachers and students, which shows how well they get along with each other. Another event that should absolutely be captured on film is the preparation of the meals in the canteen.

Sometimes shopping can be a stressing experience though people think of it as an enjoyable part of their lives.\nFirst of all, shopping can be a good thing if it is a possibility to forget about all the problems you have, even if it is just for a moment. It relieves you from the pressure of life while you are looking for something to buy.\nOn the other hand, sometimes you can get really nervous about shopping like when you have to deal with unhelpful shop assistants. It is a very common fact these days and you have to be patient if you really want to buy something.\nFurthermore, sometimes you can not find a variety of goods and you eventually buy a low quality product.\nIn conclusion, like all things in life, shopping can be pleasent or irritating depending on your patience and on your mood that day.", "['TV', 'DJ', 'RN', 'RJ', 'UT', 'MP', 'RN', 'RV', 'S']", "{'filename': '0100_2000_6/doc2574.xml'}"]}

But I can't help accepting it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable.\nFor example, any shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends. Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins. What's worse, there is usually traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall. And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare. So I prefer shopping at weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment.\nHowever, people can't have a good time even at weekdays while shopping. Shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get. In addition, they can get angry with a shop assistant because of bad service.\nFor the handicapped, going shopping is not easy and it can be very bothering unless shops have facilities for them.\nDespite all these things which show that shopping is not always enjoyable, people have to go shopping.

I thought it was a great opportunity to see how things turn out so well when you put everybody's different talents together.

Maybe there will be some robots to do our ironings, washing our dishes, cleaning everywhere, hoovering, etc. Will it make life easier? Maybe yes, maybe no. Of course these gadgets will do our hard houseworks but we will get lazy, we will lose our abilities that we have now.\nNow IT (information technology) is our life.

Then there will have been built smaller houses, flats, buildings, etc. Outside big cities there won't be any people at all.

That's as simple as this! Everyone is aware of the celebrity's consequences so, if they really wanted their privacy, why did they choose a \"public job\"??

However, in my opinion, famous people, such as politicians and film actors, deserve to have a private life.\nFirst of all, everybody has rights to keep their own private life, especially when they are in serious situations such as divorce and a family member's or the closest friend's death. It is too cruel for them to be monitored their feelings at that time.\nAnother reason that I agree famous people deserve to have a private life is that if journalists followed them all the time, it would result in their death. For example, if Diana, who was ex-wife of Prince Charles, hadn't been followed by paparachi when she was dating with a guy, there wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death.\nTo sum up, nobody wants to be revealed their private life on public.

Indeed, it can be useful for their career. The more they are in the media, the more they will be famous. According to me, some of them need to be appreciated by fans, they need to be loved and see themselves on television. However, some others only use the media to come back, because they cannot find a job anymore. They need to be famous again. Besides, I consider that some stars sometimes call journalist to tell them where they will be, in order to have free advertisement. Moreover, according to me, it is also a good way for them to earn money. Famous people are so often asked to give interview that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it, either in the newspapers or on television.\nOn the other hand, for other famous people, being followed by journalists is the worst element of the fame. In my opinion, it must be so stressful to endure the pressure they have to be perfect all the time because they could be followed by a photograph. They cannot go to public places, unless they make-up themselves and they are ready to sign autographs. They would really like a normal life, either because it is their temper, a regarding to their children. Nevertheless, they are never let alone, which is a shame.

They should understand when it is too much, when they are going too far.\nFor instance, the tragic death of Princess Diana is an example of what a journalist must not do. In this occasion we can say that the journalists have, of course indirectly, caused her death.\nOn the other hand, the famous people have to understand that the people are interested in their lives. If one is famous it has to accept also the disadvantages of be famous.\nThe famous people must enderstand that the journalists are doing their work.\nIn my view Prince Charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media. When he goes skiing in Switzerland he always stops for a while to talk with the journalists and to give the photographers the chance to take pictures. After this break he continues to ski without be annoyed for the rest of the holiday.\nIn conclusion I think that there must be more compehension and respect between famous people and the media.", "['FN', 'UD', 'RN', 'UD', 'UD', 'MP', 'RA', 'FV', 'UD', 'S', 'RN', 'FV', 'RN', 'S']", "{'filename': '0100_2000_12/doc2644.xml'}"]}

Cars take a big part in our life. Everywhere you look you can see cars. More and more people learn how to drive and choose to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time comper to travelling by public transport. Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport. You don't have to wait on a bus stop on a cold and windy weather for a late bus, or being stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs, you can just jump into a car, tune your radio onto your favourite station and have a plesant drive to your distanation.\nCars are even more important for emergency situations such as fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill. Could you imagine if our police, doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot? I don't think I need to comment on this.\nFrom my personal experience I realised how it's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa. I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I couldn't drive at that time. Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live. I couldn't just go for a walk, it was too dangerous. There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time, and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else. There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality life for my daughter and myself.\nSince I passed my driving test I can not understand how I used to live without a car before.

Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you can't attend her garden party because of an illness, without having to look her in the eye? When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea of how popular it would be one day. Its first appliance was to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person. Nowadays, however, the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it.\nTake me, for example, I use it whenever there is a problem and I need some advice, or when I have to call off a meeting for any reason. I cannot always walk to the person and say \"Sorry, I must cancel our meeting\", because then it's too late anyway, isn't it?\nLife definitely wouldn't be the same without the invention of the telephone. We use it daily in order to get information or to pass it on.\nJust try to spend one week without using a telephone at all, and you will see that it is impossible to do so.

You pay only for the entry and you can stay in all the time that you want. On the other hand, if you are more than 10 people, you can have a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person.

You can now know what happens on the other side of the world, at the same time it is happening. What is more, you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the \"enter\" key in a computer.\nFurthermore, as we all know, day life now a days is quite simplier and an example of this is that instead of buying a peice of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and cooler. Strange as it seems, we now can have every machine or especialized technology to make our dayly life more confortable and less workable. Things that human beings used to do, now are being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly.\nOne the other hand, despite the fact that technology make things easier in our day life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people.

If I want to go to training I need not wait for the bus, and so I need not start one and a half hour before training I start a half hour before. So I save one hour, which I can use for other hobbies or for homework or something else. The same with mobile phones, if I got one I needn't go to the public phones, I save time.

Fashion is changing so quickly that all our dreams about clothes can become true. But let's see my point of view. In a hundred years, clothes would certainly be totally differents than ours. Materials, textures and colours change, and are minds too.\nSo I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like bottles of aluminium. And I hope colours won't be dark and sad but very bright and enjoyable to see.\nI think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not in jeans. Syntethic materials have grown up and become very popular so it would keep going on. But maybe the shape of the clothes will changed: large pants as, or trousers with many pockets as we see today. For women, clothes change more than for men's. It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of clothes. I guess they will wear a sort of tunique upon a shirt and a skirt, or more male clothes because they want to change. Finally it's very difficult to say that.\nMaybe Luc Besson's \"Fifth Element\" movie is quite a good example. The clothes were designed by the famous Jean-Paul Gaultier.

Firstly, in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be Danny Brook. An actor that I admire and I wanted to see him performing. Unfortunately instead of Brook I saw another actor, totally stranger to me. Secondly in the advertisement the starting time of the musical was said to be at 19:30, but the theatre started at 20:15. I don't want to be rude, but this is not proffessional at all. Another thing I would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets.\nThere wasn't any discount. Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at yor restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock. and the musical finished at 11:30.

As a result of all these advanced technological methods, I became one of the daily users of modern technology. Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages.\nThe first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer. I spend most of my time in front of the computer, either working or playing. Of course this sometimes is an advantage, when for example the computer helps me to do my job easier, but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends.

The first thing I do in the morning is start up my computer, check if I have any new e-mails, check my electronic calendar and then go to work, where I always work with a computer. The computer has become my second nature.\nAnd not only the computer. Everyday I use the microwave for heating my food and of course. I always carry with me my mobile phone. One of the greatest technological achievements and I am afraid to say that I cannot live without my mobile phone.\nIn conclusion I would like to say that modern technology is offering to the humanity to many things, some of them are good and some others are not so good.

It is a book written by Ernest Hemingway. I would really recommend you to listen to it.\nThe basic story of the book is in fact quite simple. It is about a tough old fisherman from Cuba who sails out alone in a small boat to fish. He is only aiming for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccesfull for 86 days. This day he is lucky. He get a big swordfish hooked and after a long fight the fish is finally catched.\nOn his way back home to port he is attacked by sharks who eats his catched pice by pice. The fisherman kills many sharks with different weapons, but when he reaches port there is only head, tail and bones left of the huge swordfish. Mr. Hemingway makes this simple story a real adventure. He make you experience in detail all the struggles the fisherman has when he fights with the swordfish and the sharks. The fisherman is a typical old, strong and lonely hero of Mr. Hemingway. This tale is very amazing and it is no surprise Mr. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for it.\nI really think you should take your time and listen to it on the radio on Wednesday next week.\nBest regards\nSven Reitgard", "['RV', 'MP', 'MP', 'RV', 'S', 'AGV', 'IV', 'AGV', 'AS', 'IV', 'S', 'S', 'RJ', 'MD', 'AGV', 'ID', 'UC', 'FV']", "{'filename': '0102_2000_6/doc2608.xml'}"]}

As you asked me in it, here are some school and home rules in my country, France.\nFirst of all, and I think it's a big difference with England, children don't wear uniforms at school. I was very surprised when I saw them in your country. It was a bit funny for me.\nOf course when you're in class you have to behave yourself, be polite with the teacher and the other school children. During the break too, usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you. I think nowadays, children are more free and, I mean the contact between them and adults. Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them ( not always) but also speaks with them.\nAt home is different, each family has its own rules. As I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired. But I was a wise child, so! Usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident. There are some rules like \"don't speak with a full mouth\"; \"don't put your finger in your noise \"; \"say please and thank you\"; \"don't fight with your brother\"; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere.\nWell, I hope I've helped you a little and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\nWith lots of love,", "['M', 'R', 'R', 'RP', 'UY', 'RJ', 'RP', 'MT', 'MC', 'MA', 'RP', 'ID', 'MY', 'RJ', 'RP', 'RP', 'MP', 'RN']", "{'filename': '0102_2000_12/doc238.xml'}"]}

Firstly, there was a few stars and artists from only six countries although the advertisement mention that stars and artists would come from around the world. Secondly, some concerts took a place in really small halls. I suggest that concerts should be held in bigger halls than this year's in next year.

I actually love this rule because I don't have to get up early if I have a car. Secoundly, boys are not allowed to have long hire. They have to cut their hair once a month.

That was an excellent decision as all the events started at different time and there was plenty of them. In addition, it was reasonable-priced.\nIn conclusuon, I would like to say that in spite of the success of the festival some improvements still can be done.

Did you like it more than the previous one?\nI must say that our school rules are quite different than yours. First of all we have to stand up, when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons. If you missed a lesson, that could be a trouble for yourself. I think it depends on the school. Privat schools have more relaxed atmosphere that the state school. They don't have strike rules and students can take extra lessons.\nOn the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviours are punished. For example, you have to do more homeworks or they are sending you home etc. Of course smoking isn't allowed at any part of the schol.\nI have a relaxed family and we are sharing all the houseworks. My Father does the cooking, my mother does the cleaning and I do tidying up! But in many Families women are doing more than men. I can't accept that, because you have to share all the duties and spend more time together.\nAnyway it think that's it for now.\nI hope to hearing from you soon.\nLots of Love", "['MP', 'FV', 'R', 'TV', 'MP', 'S', 'MP', 'TV', 'R', 'UP', 'FV', 'RV', 'RN', 'RA', 'S', 'MD', 'SX', 'FN', 'SX', 'CN', 'AGV', 'CN', 'TV', 'RT', 'S', 'TV', 'CN', 'RP', 'UV', 'TV', 'RP', 'MP', 'TV', 'MP', 'RA', 'FV', 'RP']", "{'filename': '0102_2000_12/doc519.xml'}"]}

As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book. Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging to everything he faces. When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him. Real stories have huge impacts on me, and affect me a lot, often in good ways.\nIn addition to that, realistic stories are more attractive, I personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they cannot be true. But, while reading realistic stories, I just fall deep into the story, into the writer's own world. Ernest Hemingway's sentences are precise, but still very powerful and alive. So when I read other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught, I got very angry and annoyed.

By the way, I was also wondering if it was possible to have more plays and films for the coming up festival as the reaction of the people was excellent.\nActually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! I, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificient events.\nWell, I hope you found my suggestions reasonable as I deeply congratulate for the great sucess in the festival.\nyours sincerely,", "['UN', 'MT', 'AGN', 'MV', 'W', 'M', 'SX', 'UY', 'S', 'MA', 'RT', 'S', 'RT']", "{'filename': '0102_2000_12/doc1298.xml'}"]}

As you know I'm in Ferndown now spending last minutes studying for exams. I would like to ask you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on the 5th April is suitable for you. If not, pleas let me know. I'm sure we will find another solution.\nIt's very kind of you to let me use things in your flat. I'm over the moon! Can I also \"take care\" of your computer and CD player and bicycle?\nCan you also let me know when you are going to come back on the 20th. Will it be dinner time maybe? If yes, great! I will be able to see you.\nYou know that helping you it's a real pleasure for me, you really don't have to become flat broke because of buying things for me but I am interested in American culture. So tiny \"Statue of Liberty\" will be nice. I will finish now as I have mountain of work to do.

Are you sure that your diet is healthy enough to help you grow up?\nIn today's fast moving world young people spend less and less time cooking or eating healthy food. When they are at home,, parents take care of them and always prepare some good dinner with meat or a fresh salad for supper.\nHowever, students who never have time for healthy diet full of minerals, vitamins or fibre usually on \"McDonalds\", hamburgers or Bic Macs. Moreover, very often school canteen doesn't offer diversified food like different kinds of bread or salads. Usually we don't eat regularly and in good. Our grandparents always remembered the value and quality of food. They found time to eat something hot for dinner - the main meal and even if the times were worse, people were more sensible.\nIn my opinion people, especially the young, should become more aware of what and when they eat as well as they should their lifestyles and.", "['RP', 'UY', 'MP', 'R', 'RD', 'MD', 'RC', 'RV', 'R', 'S', 'MD', 'RJ', 'MN', 'MP', 'RC', 'RN', 'MP', 'RC', 'RJ', 'RC', 'RV', 'ID']", "{'filename': '0102_2001_3/doc2862.xml'}"]}

You can tell us about whatever you like. For example, a speech about your latest work would be very nice. I'm planning the event on 15 or 22 February, from 7 to 8 p.m. Please tell me which day is good for you.

Unfortunately, both of my parents are teachers. In my childhood, they were always too busy to remember my birthday and I didn't remember my birthday either.\nWhen I was 23, I joined a NGO in Denmark and stared living with other members, most of who are from Europe. On that day, I noticed that they were preparing something for me and that reminded me that it was my birthday. I had never had a birthday party before and I didn't expect much.\nThe party was far beyound my expectation. 20 people from five different countries celebrated for me.

I've had so much work at school recently (exams!) and so many things to do, that I've almost forgotten how good it is to relax and rest a bit. Fortunately, the people from my class are really great and we all love trips - especially interesting ones.\nThe boat trip you're asking about in your letter was really fantastic and well organized, there were absolutely no problems and we had lots of fun! Here are some facts for you:\nThe departures are at 8 am and 10 a.m. every day, but it's much better to set off earlier as the boat is less crowded then (I know you hate getting up early, but...). After two hours of the cruise, there is a stop at the beautiful Bourne Castle where they offer guided tours. I think such a tour is essential, because you can learn lots of interesting things about the history of the castle.\nAfter visiting the castle there is lunch at a restaurant, but you'd better take picnic - it's so beautiful there!\nIn the afternoon you can choose from a variety of water sports at the lake. Try windsurfing, you'll have lots of fun!\nI'm telling you - the trip was wonderful and I'm sure your group will like it. Especially that the prices are reasonable and if you have a group of 15 people, you get a discount.\nTry it and have fun!\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you, take care,", "['TV', 'RP', 'MD', 'RC', 'RP']", "{'filename': '0102_2001_12/doc2871.xml'}"]}

I turned around quickly, but there was nothing - the sound disappeared. I began feeling a bit scared, not that I was afraid of ghosts, but...I had this impression that something was wrong. I stopped and listened. Nothing. A complete silence.\nAfter a minute I started walking up the stairs again and I heard the same sound - it was the sound of footsteps! I was so frightened that I could barely move, but I turned my head again. There was nobody.

I couldn't believe my own eyes, so I closed them quickly and ran to my sister's room.\n\"Jane\" - I shouted - \"There is a ghost downstairs!
