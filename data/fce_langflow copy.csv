Chinese,16-20,24.0,1,3.2,"Dear Mr Ryan.
Thanks for you letter. I am so exciting that I have won the first prize. I will give you all information you need and ask some questions.
I could only travel on July. As you know, I am a student and the nearest holiday is summer holiday. But I have booked a flight to home at the beginning of Auguest. And also I would like to go on summer.
The accommodation I would like to live in tents. Because I never live in tents before. I think it is great and I want to try it.
I like doing sports. I would like to play basketball and golf when I am at the Camp. I play basketball a lot and I am a member of our college term. But I am not very good at golf.
And also I want to ask some questions. What clothes should I taken? How much money should I taken? And how could we meet at the airport? I am looking forward your reply.
Yours sincerely.","['RP', 'DD', 'RJ', 'MD', 'TV', 'RT', 'MD', 'UT', 'S', 'RT', 'MT', 'MP', 'RV', 'RP', 'TV', 'RV', 'MD', 'AGN', 'TV', 'RN', 'TV', 'TV', 'TV', 'MT']",{'filename': '0100_2000_6/doc2.xml'}
